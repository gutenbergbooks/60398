I
<br />
PERIL AND PASSION
</h3>

<p>
One midsummer morning in the late
eighteen-fifties, Boyd Westover of
Wanalah was riding along a Virginia
plantation road, accompanied by half a dozen
hounds, for whose discipline and restraint he
carried a long, flexible black-snake whip. The
weapon played the part of sceptre rather than
that of sword. The young man had no intention
of striking the dogs with it, but whenever
their exuberance broke bounds he cracked the
lash in air, making a report like that of a pistol
shot, and the reminder of his authority was
quite sufficient for purposes of canine discipline.
</p>

<p>
He was not hunting. He was merely riding
to a distant part of the plantation he controlled,
to inspect the work of the negroes there and
to give directions for its proper doing. But he
liked the company of his dogs and enjoyed
their mad relish of the morning.
</p>

<p>
The glory of it gladdened his own spirit in
spite of the vexing problems that were never
quite absent from his mind.
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover, a young man of not more
than twenty-three or twenty-four years, had
never known a serious care until the spring of
that year. Then a burden of responsibility had
fallen upon him that threatened to bend even
his broad shoulders beneath its weight.
</p>

<p>
His father had died suddenly in the early
spring, leaving a widow and this one son who
in the ordinary course of affairs became administrator
of the estate and master of the
plantation.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that the burden fell upon him.
The plantation was an unusually large one,
and its late owner had been accounted the richest
man in all the region round about, just as
his forbears for generations past had been.
Wanalah, the ancestral seat of the family, had
been for two hundred years the home of a
hospitable, high living, high mettled race of
men and women, but during the reign of Boyd
Westover's father the hospitality of Wanalah
had outdone itself in lavishness. There were
always guests in numbers there, and a multitude
of servants were withheld from profitable
industry to minister to their comfort. There
were thoroughbred horses enough in the stables
to mount half a company of cavalry, and a like
profusion was apparent in the case of every
other provision for enjoyment and the unstinted
entertainment of guests. In brief the
late master of Wanalah had kept open house
for all gentlemanly comers.
</p>

<p>
But when Boyd Westover took his degree
at the University in early June and returned
to Wanalah to assume his duties as administrator,
he learned for the first time that the
plantation had not been earning the cost of all
this high living. There was not only the
hereditary debt upon the place&mdash;a debt that
so great a plantation, wisely conducted, might
have borne comfortably&mdash;but added to it was
a confused mass of fresh debts accumulated
during his father's lifetime and in consequence
of his extravagance.
</p>

<p>
The entertainment of pleasure-seeking guests
was suspended now, of course, during the
period of mourning, and in view of the ill
health into which his mother had fallen since
the shock of his father's sudden death, the suspension
seemed likely to endure for a long
period to come.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Boyd Westover was both
perplexed and appalled by the magnitude of
the problem he was set to solve. For a time
he doubted even the solvency of the estate, but
later reckonings had shown him that this fear
was not justified, though the fact brought small
relief to his mind, for peculiar reasons connected
with the character of the property itself.
If he might have sold out everything, he could
have paid off all the debts, leaving a small but
sufficient competency for his mother's support.
As for himself, he gave no thought for the
future. He was young, strong and fit to meet
fate unarmed.
</p>

<p>
But he could not sell the property without
unpardonable offence to his own soul and to
the sentiment of the community which was to
him the world. For by far the greater part
of that property and altogether the most salable
part of it consisted of the negroes, every
one of whom had been born on Wanalah plantation
as their parents and grandparents and
great-grandparents had been before them.
Among the high class Virginians&mdash;the class
to which Boyd Westover belonged by immemorial
inheritance&mdash;it was held to be a
shamefully impossible thing to sell a negro except
for incorrigible crime, or for the purpose
of bringing a man and wife together, on one
plantation.
</p>

<p>
"I simply will not sell the servants," the
young man said to himself when matters
seemed at their worst. "Rather than do that,
I'll run them all off north, set them free and
let the estate fall into bankruptcy."
</p>

<p>
Since that time the young man's close study
of the situation had convinced him that neither
of these courses was necessary. By cutting
down the force of house servants to the measure
of his own and his mother's modest
needs, and putting every able-bodied negro at
profitable work in the crops, he was confident
that he could make the plantation carry its load
of debt and slowly reduce it.
</p>

<p>
That was now his task, and in spite of the
glory of the midsummer morning his mind was
busy planning ways and means, when suddenly
a combined baying from the hounds arrested
his attention. Looking up he saw a young
woman on horseback in a pasture not far
ahead&mdash;a young woman in difficulty and sore
danger.
</p>

<p>
Streamers of flaming red&mdash;the reason for
which he could in no wise guess&mdash;were flying
from her shoulders and a maddened bull of
huge bulk was charging her with the fury of
a bovine demon.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the young man plunged the rowels
into the flanks of his horse. An eight-rail
fence lay in his way, but there was no time in
which to throw off even one of its rails. Without
a thought of pause he urged his horse
toward it at the top of his speed, determined
to force him over it or through it as the case
might be. The weight of the steed and the
speed at which he was moving would be sufficient,
Boyd Westover thought, to crush a way
through the barrier. It was likely to cost the
beautiful animal his life, but what of that?
There was another life at stake, in rescue of
which the young man was ready to sacrifice
even his own&mdash;for the life in peril was that
of the woman he loved, the woman who had
awakened all the passion, all the tenderness,
all the chivalry of his brave young soul. To
save her he would have doomed any and every
other living thing to cruel death.
</p>

<p>
The horse he rode seemed to realize the
perilous choice his rider was forcing upon him
and to choose the safer but far more difficult
course. Putting forth all his superb strength
in utmost endeavor, he cleared the barrier at
a flying leap.
</p>

<p>
As he did so his rider saw to his horror that
the young woman's mount had faltered in her
frightened flight, and in the next instant the
beautiful mare was lifted bodily from the
ground, impaled upon the sharp horns of the
bull and evidently done to death by the goring.
As the animal fell the young woman was hurled
forward half a dozen yards, and before the
wrath-blinded bull could gather himself together
for a charge upon her prostrate form,
Boyd Westover forced his own horse between
the bull and his victim and with three or four
rapid swishes of the cruel black-snake whip
across the animal's face and eyes, sent him
staggering back.
</p>

<p>
The delay, as the young man knew, would
be but for a few seconds, but these proved sufficient
for his purpose. Turning his horse
toward the unconscious girl, he hooked his left
knee around the cantle of his saddle and, hanging
almost head downwards, seized her about
the waist. Recovering his position, he placed
her across the horse's withers. The bull was
almost upon him now, but a sharp touch of the
spurs caused the horse to spring forward at
a full run in time to save himself and his riders,
though the escape was so narrow that one
of the bull's horns tore an ugly gash in the
calf of Boyd Westover's leg.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p8"></a>
The body of the girl hung limp across the
withers, so that her rescuer knew not whether
she lived or had been killed by her fall. Until
his horse cleared the fence again&mdash;this time
scattering the upper rails as he did so&mdash;there
was no time for inquiry. But once out of the
field, the young man reined in the frantic
creature, and lifting the girl's head to his
shoulder, felt her fluttering breath upon his
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God she lives!" he exclaimed with
reverent fervor, but his efforts to rouse her to
consciousness were unavailing.
</p>

<p>
"It may be only a faint," he thought, but
such fainting as he had seen among women had
been far less enduring than this, and the memory
of that fact greatly alarmed him.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that in any case the shock produced
by the dashing of water into the face is
desirable at such times, and turning his horse's
head he rode down a slope into a shaded, grass-carpeted
dell, where a bubbling spring arose.
Gently laying the girl on the greensward, but
resting her head in his lap, he dashed handfuls
of water into her face, with the result of arousing
her almost at once. When she opened her
eyes they were vacant and dreamy, like those
of one only half awakened from sleep, but a
few moments later the light came back into
them, and she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Is it you, Boyd? Then you're not dead,
as I dreamed you were."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I'm not hurt," he replied&mdash;ignoring
his lacerated leg&mdash;"but you mustn't talk
yet. Lie still till you feel better." And with
that he gently passed his hand over her eyes,
closing them.
</p>

<p>
She lay quiet for a minute or two seemingly
asleep, and he, moved by a sudden impulse&mdash;whether
of passion or pity he knew not&mdash;bent
over and pressed his lips to hers&mdash;gently uttering
her name&mdash;"Margaret."
</p>

<p>
Instantly he repented, as she opened her
eyes and with a flushing face tried to raise herself
to a sitting posture, saying as she made the
effort.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you mustn't do that."
</p>

<p>
But the effort to rise was futile. Sharp
pain caused her to grow pale again and she
sank back as she had been.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you hurt, Margaret?" Boyd
asked in sympathetic distress.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; all over I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"Are any of your bones broken? Feel of
them and see."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon not. I can't tell. The pains are
all over me&mdash;mostly inside. I reckon I'm going
to faint."
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover was now seriously alarmed.
He vaguely remembered hearing of persons
dying of "internal injuries," though externally
showing no hurt. Instantly he lifted the
girl again and, mounting with her in his arms,
set off at a gallop toward the great house at
Wanalah.
</p>

<p>
The sharp prick of a pin, as he adjusted his
burden on the withers, attracted his attention
to the two flaming red bandana kerchiefs,
pinned by their corners to Margaret's shoulders,
and in the midst of his apprehensions for
her life he found time to wonder why she had
decorated herself in that extraordinary way.
He was too full of anxious concern to question
her on so trivial a matter, but she, recovering
herself, volunteered an explanation, after asking
him to reduce the horse's gait to a walk.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I was right foolish," she said,
laughing in spite of her pain. "You see this
is one of old Aunt Sally's birthdays. She has
one every three or four months now, and she's
rapidly adding to her ninety years&mdash;a year at
each birthday. She was my Mammy you
know, and so I always take her a present on
her birthdays."
</p>

<p>
The girl paused in her speech as some sharp
twinge of pain changed her smile into a grimace.
It was only for a moment, and she continued:
</p>

<p>
"On her last birthday, two or three months
ago, she told me I would some day be an angel
with red wings, and so when I set out this
morning to take her these two turban kerchiefs,
the foolish whim came to me to pin them to
my shoulders and make red wings of them."
</p>

<p>
Again an access of severe pain silenced
speech and she closed her eyes while her lips
grew pale. Evidently the effort to chatter had
been too much for her, and Boyd rightly
guessed that she had been forcing herself to
talk of her little prank by way of preventing
him from saying more serious things which
she did not wish just then to hear.
</p>

<p>
He in his turn resolved to say those more
serious things at the earliest opportunity. He
felt that in caressing her as he had done, down
there by the spring, he had placed himself under
a binding obligation to explain at the first
possible opportunity, and the explanation could
take but one form&mdash;a full and free declaration
of his yet unspoken passion. This, he felt, he
had no right to delay one moment longer than
he must, but as she lay still with closed eyes,
her head upon his shoulder and his arm about
her, he realized that his present and very pressing
task was to place her as soon as possible
in the tender care of his mother and her maids.
</p>

<p>
The rest must wait.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

II
<br />
A SONG WITHOUT WORDS
</h3>

<p>
The physician for whom Boyd Westover
sent a young negro at breakneck
speed, while his mother's maids were
getting Margaret Conway to bed, reported that
she had "sustained painful contusions" and
was additionally "suffering from shock," but
that no bones were broken and, so far as he
could determine, no serious internal injuries
had befallen. He directed that she should remain
in bed for a few days, and then stay
quietly at Wanalah, without attempting a
homeward journey until he should himself give
permission.
</p>

<p>
"Above all," he said to Boyd, "she must
not be excited in any way&mdash;pleasurably or the
reverse&mdash;lest hysteria supervene."
</p>

<p>
Boyd smiled a little over the medical man's
stilted diction, and rejoiced in the assurance
of Margaret's safety which the ponderous
phraseology gave him. But upon reflection he
chafed a good deal over the restraint the doctor's
instructions required him to put upon
himself. He was impatient now to put into
words the declaration of love which his caresses
had implied and promised. He was still
more impatient for her reply to that declaration,
for, like the modest young lover that he
was, he gravely feared his fate and was annoyed
by the necessity of waiting before putting
it to the test.
</p>

<p>
Her words, spoken half consciously when
she had received or repelled his embraces&mdash;for
he could not determine in his own mind
whether she had meant to do the one or the
other&mdash;in no wise encouraged his self-confidence.
He recalled those words:&mdash;"I reckon
you mustn't do that"&mdash;and questioned them
closely as to their significance, but no satisfactory
answer came. The utterance might mean
anything or nothing. And what did the suddenly
flushing face that accompanied it suggest?
Was it joy or sorrow, pleasure or resentment
that had sent the blood to her cheeks
in that way, and prompted her attempt to
escape him by rising? Wonder as he might
he could not tell, and as he paced the colonnaded
porch that night after all the house was
asleep, he succeeded only in working himself
into a passionate fury of impatience and maddening
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
He tried to reason with himself, only to find
himself utterly unreasonable. Doubtless Margaret
would be enjoying the air in the porch
within a few days, resting and perhaps interestingly
helpless still. The attentions he must
lavish upon her in that case promised abundant
opportunity for a tenderness of care which
would open the way for his passionate declaration.
At that point in his planning another
and a very annoying thought obtruded itself.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it!" he muttered, "Colonel
Conway is a stickler for all the conventions of
our artificial social life. He will insist upon
the idiotic rule that a young man mustn't address
a girl in his own house or at any time
when she is under his protection. What utter
nonsense it is, anyhow! But I suppose I must
obey it or bring down Colonel Conway's wrath
upon my head. I must let all my opportunities
slip away, and restrain my impulses during all
the time she's here, making myself seem to her
a cold-blooded brute who has taken advantage
of her helplessness to force caresses upon her
and then doesn't think enough of her dignity
to explain himself."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Boyd Westover's mood was playing
tricks with his logical faculties. It is certain
that if he had been asked at any ordinary time
his opinion of the social requirement which
he now scorned as an idiotic convention, he
would have answered that it was eminently
right and reasonable, that it was imperatively
necessary indeed, for the protection of the
young woman in the case against the embarrassment
of having to accept hospitality or escort
or favor of other kind from a man whose
proffer of love she has just rejected.
</p>

<p>
But who expects an impatient lover to be
reasonable&mdash;who that has ever been himself
a lover? Reasonable or unreasonable, Boyd
Westover felt himself bound to observe the
rule that imposed so annoying a restraint upon
him. He might fret and fume in revolt against
it, but he must bend to the custom. He resolved
to wait with what grace he could until
Margaret's return to her own home. He
worked out in his mind all the situations that
were likely to occur during her convalescence
at Wanalah, and framed all the conversations
to fit the embarrassing circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Of course the situations that actually arose
were totally different from those he had imagined,
and the dialogues he had rehearsed
proved to be as unfit for use as the text of a
Greek tragedy would be on a modern comedy
stage.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Conway, who happened to be in
Richmond when his daughter's mishap occurred,
returned at once and, after learning the
details, delivered his thanks and commendations
in a way that overwhelmed her rescuer
with embarrassment. It was in vain that
Boyd protested, disclaimed any right or title
to the Colonel's extravagant eulogies of his
conduct, and declared that he had done no
more than any other man would have done
under like circumstances. Colonel Conway
would not have it so.
</p>

<p>
"You gravely imperilled your own life,
sir," he replied in his peremptory way. "You
went to the rescue of a damsel in distress as
only a gallant knight would do, with reckless
disregard of all consequences to yourself.
That's what I call heroism, sir, heroism worthy
of the name you bear and the proud race from
which you are sprung. Now don't protest,
don't contradict, don't argue, don't answer. It
is only your modesty that shrinks from the
recognition of your gallantry"&mdash;and so on
with what Boyd felt to be "damnable iteration."
</p>

<p>
But when the old gentleman had gone back
to Richmond, leaving his daughter to the care
of Boyd Westover's mother, the young man
reflected that the Colonel's enthusiasm would
probably stand him in good stead if ever Margaret
should smile upon his suit and give him
leave to ask her father for her hand.
</p>

<p>
Thus in meditations sometimes hopeful and
joyous, sometimes perplexed and desponding,
Boyd Westover worried through the days until
the glad morning came when Margaret Conway
rebelled against her physician's orders and
made her appearance in the porch. She was
still weak enough and enough distressed by her
bruises to be treated as a convalescent to
whom solicitous attention was due, and of
course Boyd elected himself her "gentleman in
waiting."
</p>

<p>
These two, brought up on adjoining plantations,
had known each other from their earliest
childhood, but in later years they had seen
little of each other. Boyd had been away,
first at boarding-school and afterwards at the
University, while the motherless girl had been
slowly and awkwardly growing to womanhood,
under care of her aunt and the tutelage
of an accomplished governess. It was only
during vacations that the two had met, and
during the last two summers they had not met
at all, for the reason that Margaret, with her
father, had been travelling in the North and
Canada and in what was then the great West
during both those seasons.
</p>

<p>
It was with surprise, therefore, not unmixed
with the awe of strangeness, that on his return
from the University this year he had found
his little playmate grown into a beautiful and
very dignified womanhood. She presided now
at The Oaks, her father's plantation, with all
the gracious ease that enabled Virginia women
of that time to make of plantation houses delightful
centres of unruffled hospitality, where
the coming and going of guests was in no way
a matter of previous arrangement and where
neither the coming nor the going created the
smallest ripple in the placid self-composure of
the well-ordered life of the mansion.
</p>

<p>
So great was the change in her, or so great
did it seem to Boyd, that at first he hesitated
and faltered over the old familiar form of address.
It did not seem possible to him to call
this dignified and almost stately young woman
"Margaret" as he had always called the little
girl that she had been. He could not address
her as "Miss Conway" but he thought he
might compromise on the form "Miss Margaret."
The first time he addressed her in that
fashion was the only time. She looked at
him in dignified surprise for a moment; then
with a rippling little laugh that seemed to him
singularly charming, she said:
</p>

<p>
"If we have become such strangers, Boyd,
that you must put a handle to my name, I'll
give you all your honors and address you as
'Boyd Westover, Esq., M. A., University of
Virginia.' You are to call me just 'Margaret,'
please, as you've always done, if you wish to
be just 'Boyd' to me."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke the words all the winsomeness
he remembered in the girl came back again,
but it did not dissipate the stately dignity that
had grown upon her with her ripening womanhood.
It was perhaps at that moment that he
fell in love with her. Of that he could never
be sure, but he knew now that his love for her
was the one supreme passion of his life. That
knowledge had come to him at the moment
when he first realized her danger out there in
the pasture. He recalled now the impulse that
had prompted him in his half mad determination
to let no obstacle stand in the way of his
reaching her in time for rescue. He remembered
the horror that had rended his very soul
as he saw the maddened bull lift the mare and
her rider and fling them from his gory horns.
He knew now that he had done and dared in
those maddening moments, not with the humane
impulse to save an imperilled life that
must come to every man with blood in his
veins, but actuated by his passionate love's instinct
of self-preservation.
</p>

<p>
As he ministered to her after her return to
the porch, all these memories were awakened
in him by a certain change that had come over
her, a shyness that was not quite reserve, but
yet resembled it. He was too little acquainted
with the ways of women to understand this
or to estimate it aright. It did not occur to
him that the revelation he had made to her by
his passionate caress as she lay half conscious
in his arms might explain her impulse of reserve.
He was too scantily versed in the impulses
of womanhood to understand that after
such a manifestation of his love womanly modesty
must stand upon its defence until such
time as he should see fit to give more formal
and definite expression to his purpose.
</p>

<p>
Yet to that caress he attributed the change.
It was only that he misinterpreted its meaning.
The thought came to him that he had mortally
offended her, that she resented his act in the
only way possible to her so long as she must
remain a guest in his mother's house, and that
upon her release from that restraint she would
banish him forever from her presence and her
acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
So severely did all this torture him that on
the second day of her convalescence the impulse
to make an end of suspense overcame him,
banishing for the moment all considerations of
prudence and all regard for conventionalities.
He had read to her for an hour, and when the
book was finished, he observed a certain restlessness
on her part, for which he suggested
one or two remedies, only to have his suggestions
negatived. Presently she said:
</p>

<p>
"It is only that I need exercise, I reckon.
I think I'll try to walk a little, up and down the
porch." She rose with some difficulty, he taking
her hand in assistance. But no sooner
was she on her feet than she relaxed her grasp
upon his hand, and, as he did not relax his
own so readily, she seemed to shake it off.
The act was not an impatient one, but he mistook
it for such. Instantly he faced her, asking:
</p>

<p>
"Why did you do that, Margaret? Why
have you tried in every way to show me that
my presence is disagreeable to you? What
have I done to offend you? Tell me, and I'll
quit the plantation at once and stay away so
long as you remain. I have a right to know.
Tell me!"
</p>

<p>
For answer the young woman looked at
him in silence but with tear drops glistening
in her eyes. At last she said:
</p>

<p>
"You have done nothing that you ought not,
I reckon&mdash;nothing to offend me. Oh, Boyd,
I'm not angry with you&mdash;I can never feel
that way. I owe my life to you, but that isn't
it. I don't know what it is. May be it's just
because I'm weak&mdash;or may be just because."
</p>

<p>
With that the tears released themselves and
trickled down her cheeks. She could not restrain
them and she made no effort to hide
them. She simply stood there facing him and
letting the honest tears flow unrestrained.
</p>

<p>
There was no need of second sight to foretell
the result. Nothing in all the world so
unseats a man's resolution as the vision of the
woman he loves in tears. Boyd Westover was
a full-blooded young man and he acted after
his kind. He took the unresisting girl in his
arms and passionately embraced her. Words
on either side were unnecessary. Love is quick
to understand. But the words came also, after
a space&mdash;words of love beyond recalling,
words of the kind that make or mar human
lives and set Destiny its tasks.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap03"></a>
III
<br />
A WOMAN'S WORD
</h3>

<p>
Those were halcyon days that followed,
while Margaret lingered at
Wanalah. The barriers were broken
down now between these two; the vexing suspense
was over and the most precious certainty
that human kind can know had taken its place.
</p>

<p>
And there was not the embarrassment of
others' knowing. No word of their awakened
love had been spoken, or could be spoken until
Margaret's return to The Oaks should impose
upon her lover the duty of announcing their
understanding to her father and invoking his
sanction of their troth. Until that time should
come they were not "engaged" and might
pass their days and nights under one roof without
offending even Virginian propriety. Convention
had no claim to control over them in
those blissful intervening days.
</p>

<p>
But the shadow of it fell on the morning of
the day when Margaret was to journey homewards
in company with her maid.
</p>

<p>
"I will visit Colonel Conway at The Oaks
to-morrow," Boyd promised as the pair strolled
through the garden during the morning hours
that alone remained to them now.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how he will receive the news&mdash;our
news, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"How he will receive it? Why, of course
he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's rather rigid, you know, in his views
of propriety, and I've sinned against light in
that respect. You see I addressed you in my
own home, and not only so, but at a time when
you were not able to run away."
</p>

<p>
Margaret laughed half below her breath.
</p>

<p>
"That was very terrible of course," she said
in an amused tone. "But I see a way out of
it, Boyd."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do. That's feminine instinct.
But tell me about it."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's simple enough. If Father finds
fault with that, you can take it all back and
say it all over again at The Oaks."
</p>

<p>
Boyd smiled over the conceit, but he was not
reassured by it. The case was one in which
the least shadow of uncertainty seemed more
than he could endure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh I forgot," the girl went on, teasingly;
"perhaps it wouldn't be agreeable to you to
rehearse the scene."
</p>

<p>
Boyd said not a word in reply, but he managed
in another way to convince her that her
doubt on that point was unfounded. When she
had readjusted the "flat" that she wore as
headgear&mdash;it had somehow become disarranged&mdash;she
put jest aside, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I think we needn't fear anything of that
sort, Boyd. My father is apt to make distinctions,
just as other people are. If he disliked
you or disapproved of you, he would make
trouble of course; but as it is I reckon he will
brush the thing aside and scold about the
idiocy that makes such silly rules."
</p>

<p>
She paused in her speech for a space. Then
she added, in a tone which the young man
afterwards recalled in doubt and distress:
</p>

<p>
"At any rate it makes no difference. Nothing
can make any difference&mdash;now."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, please," he said gently, "just
what you mean by that."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a women to love lightly, or lightly
to forget. Love seems to me a holy thing and
to trifle with it is blasphemy. I have given
you my love, Boyd, and there is no power in
all the universe that can make me take it back.
Even you could not do that. Nothing you
might do&mdash;even if it were crime itself&mdash;could
alter the fact that my love is all yours,
now and forever."
</p>

<p>
He drew her to him in a tender embrace, but
spoke no word in reply. Speech in such a case
must be an impertinence. Presently she went
on:
</p>

<p>
"That is what I meant, Boyd. I have promised
to be your wife. I shall keep that promise
if the stars fall. I have no doubt my father
will cordially give his consent; but if it should
be otherwise, it will make no difference&mdash;I
shall keep my promise."
</p>

<p>
How those words came back in after time
to Boyd Westover! And how he pondered
them in amazement and bitterness of soul!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap04"></a>
IV
<br />
THE BEST LAID PLANS
</h3>

<p>
Margaret was right in her anticipations
regarding Colonel Conway's
attitude. He highly approved of the
young man upon whose gallantry in rescue he
had enthusiastically and incessantly descanted
in all companies. He was in no mood to find
fault with the slight lapse of Boyd Westover
from conventional propriety. He liked the
way in which Boyd presented his case, neither
justifying his conduct by argument nor offering
excuses for it, but treating it as a matter
of manhood necessity.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I should not have addressed
Margaret when I did," he said in manly fashion;
"I ought to have waited, but under the
circumstances I couldn't help myself. Hang
it, Colonel, there are times when a man must
do things he ought not."
</p>

<p>
"Right, my boy, altogether right, absolutely
right, eternally right," was the enthusiastic
response. "It's blood that flows in your veins&mdash;hot
blood&mdash;and not tepid milk and water.
Why, sir, I courted Margaret's mother as we
hung to the gunwale of a capsized sailboat,
and I've been proud of it all my life, sir. A
mollycoddle would have waited for her to comb
her hair and put on dry clothes while he was
making up pretty speeches for the occasion.
That's the mollycoddle's way. The man's way
is to tell the girl he loves her, whenever the
right moment comes, and leave the dry clothes
and the pretty speeches for another time. So
don't apologize, don't fret, don't give the thing
another thought. You shall have Margaret's
hand with her father's blessing whenever you
and she choose to fix upon the day. I'll pack
The Oaks with the best of good company;
there shall be feasting and&mdash;oh, by the way,
there's one little formality I suppose you'll have
to go through. There's Margaret's aunt,&mdash;my
sister Betsy, you know. It'll be best all
around if you treat her with distinguished consideration.
She's apt to stand upon her dignity,
and I've always found it best to recognize
the fact, gracefully. It ministers to peace and
comfort. I think you and Margaret had better
present yourselves to her together, and do the
thing up with all the formalities. It will not
be necessary to mention to her the little slip
you've been confessing to me. She'd probably
take it seriously. It's a way she has. You
can just let her think the thing occurred here
to-day. You and Margaret can go out into the
garden after dinner, and when you return present
yourselves to Betsy and tell her about it
as if it had just happened."
</p>

<p>
With the reassurance of the solemn words
Margaret had spoken the day before, Boyd
Westover had no great fear of anything "Aunt
Betsy" might say, but he was disposed to
humor Colonel Conway, and besides he foresaw
that life at The Oaks might be pleasanter
for Margaret with the old lady's approval than
without it. So the little diplomatic stratagem
was carried out so successfully that Aunt Betsy&mdash;always
chary in the bestowal of praise&mdash;said
to Margaret that night:
</p>

<p>
"If you must marry,&mdash;and I suppose you
must,&mdash;I'm glad you're to marry a young
gentleman who observes the courtesies of life
and knows how to treat his elders with proper
respect. I rather approve of Mr. Boyd Westover."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Aunt Betsy," Margaret answered,
concealing a smile. "You don't often
say so much in praise of a young man."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not. In these days it's not easy
to find young gentlemen who deserve any
praise at all. Manners are so dreadfully lax
nowadays. Even you shock and distress me
frequently, in spite of the pains I've taken to
train you properly."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Aunt Betsy, what have I been doing
now? Is it something dreadful?"
</p>

<p>
"From my point of view it is. You spoke
of Mr. Boyd Westover just now, by implication
at least, as a 'young man.' A young lady
doesn't associate with 'young men'; those
whom she recognizes are young <i>gentlemen</i>."
</p>

<p>
"If you'd seen him encounter that bull and
snatch me from under his horns, Aunt Betsy,
I reckon you'd have thought him a good deal
of a man."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;a good deal of a gentleman rather.
The distinction is important, my dear, though
I can't make you see it. And besides he's so
polite to his elders, especially ladies. I was
never more respectfully treated in my life.
He's just like the young gentlemen of my time.
Of course when he addressed you he sank
upon his knees&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He certainly did nothing of the kind,"
Margaret answered hotly. "If he had I should
have spurned him with contempt. No man
who respects himself would bend his knee to
any woman."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would say 'gentleman' and
'lady'&mdash;and especially wouldn't call yourself
a 'woman,' Margaret. It's positively shocking.
But it's so with everybody in these degenerate
days&mdash;even well-bred young girls,
and Heaven is my witness that I've tried hard,
to raise you well. When did he address you
the first time?"
</p>

<p>
"There was only this one time," Margaret
answered, dreamily, as she recalled the scene
on the porch.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean, Margaret, that you accepted
him the first time he asked you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Aunt Betsy, why not? I loved him."
</p>

<p>
"Margaret, you shock me; worse than that,
your conduct grieves and afflicts me. Haven't
I told you a thousand times that no lady ever
forgets her dignity so far as that?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't counted the times, Aunt Betsy,
but probably your estimate of a thousand isn't
far wrong. It is more than five hundred at
any rate."
</p>

<p>
"Margaret, you trifle, and I'm not accustomed
to be trifled with."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Aunt Betsy. I didn't
mean to trifle. Listen to me seriously now.
I hold the love of a man and a woman to be
the holiest thing on earth. I regard all trifling
with it as blasphemy, and I think all your rules
and conventionalities concerning it silly and
sinful nonsense. If there is ever a time when
a woman should be honest and truthful it is
when the man she loves tells her of his love
and asks for hers in return. There, I have
shocked you dreadfully, I know, but you forced
me to do it. I have spoken the truth as my
soul sees it."
</p>

<p>
Without another word the high-strung girl
quitted the room. It was the first time in her
life that she had "broken bounds" with her
aunt, and her self-assertion astonished even
herself. But she did not and would not repent
of it. Love had brought to her a new dignity
of womanhood, that was all.
</p>

<p>
During the week that followed Boyd Westover
found himself a busier man than he had
ever been before. He was up at dawn to set
going the day's work in the crops, and not
long after sunrise he was apt to appear at The
Oaks where Margaret awaited his coming for
their early morning ride. After breakfast with
her he returned to his fields, but by four o'clock
he was at The Oaks again for dinner. His
evenings were spent in his own chamber, where
he toiled over papers until far into the night,
in an effort to master every detail of the financial
condition of the Wanalah estate.
</p>

<p>
When he had done so, he asked for a conference
with Colonel Conway, to whom he explained
his plans.
</p>

<p>
"I find that the interest charged on nearly
all the notes my father gave is higher than it
ought to be; on some it is positively extortionate.
My father was an optimist, I suppose,
and he seems to have fallen among thieves&mdash;money
lenders, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"One and the same thing," said the elder
man. "I know their kind. I'm myself a victim.
Go on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as I figure it out, the excessive interest
the estate is paying&mdash;I mean the amount
of interest in excess of a reasonable rate&mdash;eats
up about half the tobacco crop every year,
and I've decided to stop it, just as we stop
the depredations of the worms and grasshoppers."
</p>

<p>
"Good! But how?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I'm going to Richmond, and perhaps
to the North if necessary, to find some
one who will take a single mortgage loan for
the whole amount of the estate's debts, a loan
carrying a reasonable rate of interest. With
the proceeds I'll cancel all the present debts,
and thereafter the estate will have but one
creditor, pay a moderate interest and devote
every dollar of surplus earnings to a steady
reduction of the principal. I've figured the
whole thing out, and with ordinarily fair crops
and a reasonable style of living, I can extinguish
the entire debt in ten years or less."
</p>

<p>
The two went together over the figures, and
the older man, who was both shrewd and experienced,
pronounced the plan entirely sound
and feasible. It remained only to find the
bank, insurance company, or other financial institution
that would make the loan.
</p>

<p>
In search of that, Boyd Westover set off
almost at once for Richmond. As he rode
away after parting with Margaret he turned in
his saddle and gaily waved her a last adieu,
quite as if the parting were expected to be for
months or years instead of for the brief tale of
days the youth assigned to it.

<br />
PLEASANT DREAMS AND AN UGLY AWAKENING
</h3>

<p>
Boyd Westover sat in his hotel
room about nine o'clock in the evening.
Papers, mostly memoranda, lay scattered
about upon his table, while some large
sheets were spread out before him. On these
he was making calculations.
</p>

<p>
He was a thorough-going person by nature
and habit, and he was making careful estimates
of the several offers he had secured for the
making of the desired loan on Wanalah plantation,
in an effort to determine which of
them he might most wisely accept.
</p>

<p>
Finally he said to himself:
</p>

<p>
"The Milhauser offer is the best, or will be
if I can persuade the agent to accept a mortgage
instead of the deed of trust he wants.
Perhaps I can. He didn't make the condition
peremptory, and he clearly wants to secure the
loan as an investment. I'll see him in the
morning. No, by the way, he said I'd find
him at home this evening if I should want to
see him. I'll walk out to his house now."
</p>

<p>
Turning to the table he took up one of the
memorandum sheets and read at top the number
of the agent's house in far upper Broad
Street.
</p>

<p>
"It's almost out of town," he muttered.
"Must be out beyond Richmond College.
But the walk will do me good, and I'll sleep
better if I can get the thing settled to-night."
</p>

<p>
He put an extinguisher over the camphene
lamp, and set out without overcoat or wrap
of any kind. It was a warm, cloudy summer
night, and the Virginians rarely wore overcoats
even in winter. They were horsemen,
all of them, and even the lightest overcoat is
a burden and a nuisance to one riding on
horseback.
</p>

<p>
As he walked up Grace Street beneath the
spreading shade trees, it began to rain, not
heavily but steadily. Westover was too well
accustomed to the out of door life to think of
turning back because of a drizzle, but as the
rain increased he turned up the collar of his
coat and drew his soft felt hat down over his
eyes. Presently he stopped under a street lamp
and consulted a paper which he drew from his
pocket. Some detail of the negotiation had escaped
his mind and he stopped thus to refresh
his memory.
</p>

<p>
As he stood there under the lamp with his
back turned away from the sidewalk Sam Anderson,
an acquaintance of his own, passed,
and recognizing him called out:
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Boyd! Reading a love letter by the
light of a street lamp in a soaking rain? You'd
better go indoors somewhere unless you want
to imagine tear drops punctuating the tender
missive."
</p>

<p>
Boyd turned and made some careless reply.
The two separated&mdash;Boyd going on up Grace
Street and turning north to Broad, while Anderson
hurried down town.
</p>

<p>
The incident was utterly trifling in itself,
but it was destined to exercise a baleful influence
upon Boyd Westover's life.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly an hour after midnight when
the young man presented himself again at the
hotel office and asked for his key. The night
clerk observed that he was soaked and dripping,
for the rain was falling in torrents now,
and suggested the need of a little fire in Boyd's
room. The fire was ordered, as the night had
grown chill in spite of the season, and by the
time he had got himself into dry clothes, the
blaze of the soft coal had made the room so
cheerful that the young man decided to write
letters before going to bed. One of them was
addressed to Colonel Conway, and in it Boyd
announced his success in arranging the loan,
setting forth the terms secured and going minutely
into detail. In the other, which was
addressed to Colonel Conway's daughter, he
told again of his success, giving no details at
all, but setting forth his rosy anticipations of
the coming time&mdash;now not far away&mdash;when
she should be "my lady of Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
The letter to Colonel Conway was a long
one of necessity; that to Margaret was much
longer without any necessity at all. But even
the longest letter must come to an end sometime,
and at last, about four o'clock in the
morning, Boyd Westover crept into bed, a man
altogether happy in the present and confidently
hopeful of the future. And why not? Fortune
was bringing him its richest gifts. Love
was already his and the future held out to him
an assured promise of happiness and peace in
the plantation life he loved. Now that he had
succeeded in arranging his financial affairs to
his liking, he had no vexing problems to
wrestle with, no cause of anxiety of any kind.
With Margaret for his wife, with an ample
sufficiency of this world's goods, he had only to
conduct his plantation affairs, to entertain his
friends, and to keep company with his books.
</p>

<p>
It was of all this he dreamed when he sank
to sleep.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke a constable stood by his
bedside, with two of his assistants a few feet
farther away.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, sir," said the constable. "I don't
like to wake a gentleman, sir, and still less in
a case like this. If it was only a common
criminal, sir, I shouldn't mind, but with a
young gentleman, my duty ain't no ways a
pleasant job."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, you ruffian?" angrily
asked Westover springing out of bed. "Why
do you presume to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Taint presumin' I reckon," answered the
constable, "when I've got this fer my authority.
Read it, sir, and see."
</p>

<p>
Boyd hastily glanced at the paper. It was
a warrant for his arrest on a charge of burglary.
</p>

<p>
He laughed a little, as he proceeded to dress,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Of course this is a ludicrous mistake, but
you are not to blame for it. Those who are
will have to answer for their blundering. I'm
ready. Take me to the magistrate."
</p>

<p>
"He don't git up this soon in the mornin',
sir. He was woke up to 'tend to this thing,
an' he wa'n't in no pleasant frame o' mind
'bout it nuther. I reckon he'll lay abed late
this mornin' to make up his lost sleep, like. I
don't reckon he'll show hisself in court till 'long
'bout noon."
</p>

<p>
"Where will you take me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it'll have to be the lock-up, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The lock-up? You mean a jail?"
</p>

<p>
"Well jail's the straightaway name fer it,
but we mostly calls it lock-up. Seems softer
like."
</p>

<p>
"Now my man, listen to me. You have no
right to put me in jail. Your warrant merely
directs you to arrest me and bring me to court.
It says nothing about locking me up in jail. I
tell you there's some absurd mistake about this
thing, and when I'm brought before the magistrate
it will all be cleared up. You can detain
me until then without putting a jail indignity
upon me. Stay here at the hotel with me. Go
with me to breakfast, leaving your men on
guard outside. When the time comes take me
before the magistrate. In the meanwhile I'll
send for my lawyer and find out what's to be
done."
</p>

<p>
The constable ran his eye over the muscular
young man, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Can't be did," he replied. "You mout
make up your mind to break away, and I don't
brag o' stren'th enough to handle a limber
twig like you."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, you can bring your men with
you into the dining room and keep them with
you."
</p>

<p>
"See here, Mr. Westover," interrupted the
bailiff, "this here ain't noways a pleasant job
fer me, an' ef you'll give me your word of
honor as a gentleman that you won't git me
into no trouble by givin' me the slip or tryin'
to break bounds, I'll take the chances on you.
I won't go to breakfast with you, 'cause it 'ud
make talk ef folks saw a gentleman like you
a entertainin' a feller like me that a ways. I'll
jest set down furder down the table like, an'
leave my men outside. Is it a go?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and thank you for your consideration.
I give you my word of honor as a gentleman
that I will make no attempt to escape, either
during breakfast or at any other time, and
that when you wish me to go to the court with
you I'll go without a word. Is that sufficient?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, that's enough. A gentleman may
do things that gits him into trouble with the
courts, but I ain't never knowed a gentleman
to break his word of honor."
</p>

<p>
The constable was by no means an over-confiding
person, but the dictum he announced
was based upon the facts of a social system
with which he had been familiar all his life.
It would have been accepted without question
by any other man of his class in the commonwealth.
Thanks to it, Boyd Westover was
left free to go and come at will within the precincts
of the hotel. He hurriedly summoned
his friend and attorney, Jack Towns, and remained
in conference with him throughout the
morning.
</p>

<p>
Neither could frame any plausible conjecture
as to the meaning of the arrest. There
was nothing in any of the morning newspapers
to give even a hint toward the solution of the
mystery. It was not the practice of the Richmond
newspapers at that time to print news,
except such as related to politics. If by
chance they recorded any local happening, it
was by mere mention, in small type in some
out of the way corner of columns which were
mainly devoted to ponderous editorial essays
on affairs of state, and to a reprint of the proceedings
of Congress on the day before.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the two friends, lawyer and
client, were escorted by the bailiff to a magistrate's
court that they learned aught of the
charge against the accused man. What they
learned there was very little, but it furnished a
basis for further inquiry on their part. As
this is not a detective story, all that they
learned in court and by subsequent inquiry
may best be related directly, in another chapter.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap06"></a>
VI
<br />
OUT OF A CLEAR SKY
</h3>

<p>
On a corner of Grace Street in that part
of it which Westover had twice traversed
on the evening before, stood a
very spacious dwelling house, used at that time
as a "Select Educational Establishment for
Young Ladies." That was what the proprietor,
Monsieur Le Voiser, called it in his
circulars and the like; everybody else called it
"Le Voiser's School."
</p>

<p>
There young women, mostly the daughters
of the well to do planters, were "finished"
after the most approved fashion. The training
they had received at the hands of their
governesses and tutors was supplemented by
certain refinements of education which were
deemed necessary to the perfection of their
minds and manners. They had already learned
to strum on the piano; here they were taught
how to do so with ease and grace and with
the air of accomplished <i>pianistes</i>. Instead of
Stephen C. Foster's melodious but idiotically
sentimental songs, which they loved, they were
trained to screech "Hear me Norma," and
other "operatic pieces," which they loathed.
More important than all, they were taught
French until they could dream in that language&mdash;bad
dreams probably, if they were in harmony
with the French in which they were
cast.
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover was acquainted with a dozen
or more of Monsieur Le Voiser's pupils, they
being the daughters of his neighbors and
friends. He knew the place also, having delivered
a brief course of lectures there during
the preceding year.
</p>

<p>
About half past twelve o'clock on the night
on which he had stopped under a street lamp
to read a paper in the rain, there was an alarm
in Le Voiser's school. There were shriekings
that might have been heard a block away;
there were a few faintings, and there was a
general muster of scantily robed young women
headed by the matron of the establishment,
who was madly bent upon marching them into
the garden in spite of the pouring rain.
</p>

<p>
The alarm had gone forth that there was
"a man in the house." One girl had imprudently
asked, "Is it a burglar?" only to bring
down the matron's wrath upon her head.
</p>

<p>
"What does that matter to you, Mademoiselle?
As a properly brought up young lady
it is enough for you to know that he's a man.
You should be ashamed to need more than that
to alarm you."
</p>

<p>
It was Monsieur Le Voiser's proud boast
that "French is the language of the establishment,
and no young lady attending it is permitted
to employ any other tongue." It is perhaps
an illustration of the untrustworthiness of
educational veneering, that in this time of excitement
nobody spoke a word of French, until
the intruder, who had been hiding behind a
door, slipped from his place of concealment
and made a dash for the verandah through the
French window by which he had entered. As
he did so the light of three or four bedroom
candles held high in air fell full upon him, and
half a dozen of the girls shouted in chorus:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Regardez</i> him! It's Mr. Boyd Westover!"
</p>

<p>
The consternation which fell upon the excited
group at this announcement seemed to
afford a sufficient occasion for several interesting
attacks of hysteria, in the execution of
which one damsel made the startling announcement:
</p>

<p>
"He came to kidnap me!" repeating it several
times. When she grew a little calmer so
that she might be questioned as to her meaning
she declared that Boyd Westover was
madly in love with her. Then, having set the
inventive machinery of her creative imagination
going, she told a romantic story interesting
to hear and perfectly delicious to tell.
</p>

<p>
In it she figured as a heroine of romance,
beset by the passionate entreaties of a lover to
whom she found it impossible to give her love
in return, and so forth to the end of as pretty
a story of love and coldness, persuasion and
pleading, as any that Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz
or Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth ever manufactured
for the delectation of languishing Lydias.
</p>

<p>
The girl's ambition to win interest in her
own behalf somewhat overreached itself. The
other girls were jealous of her romantic distinction
and, when they grew calm while she
got herself carried to bed, they flatly refused to
believe her story.
</p>

<p>
But there was no room for doubt that the
intruder was Boyd Westover, or that he had
forced the fastenings of a bolted window in
gaining entrance. One girl, whose father was
a lawyer, explained that this forcing of fastenings,
however frail they might have been,
constituted the crime of burglary.
</p>

<p>
Then somebody remembered that the intruder
had escaped and some one else ventured
the suggestion that steps ought to be taken
to apprehend him. To that end Monsieur Le
Voiser was summoned from his private residence
in the next street. After all the girls
who personally knew Boyd Westover, and all
those who had attended his course of lectures
had borne witness that the intruder was unmistakably
he, Monsieur proceeded to set the
machinery of the law in motion, with the results
already set forth.
</p>

<p>
When Boyd, with Jack Towns as his counsel,
presented himself before the magistrate, there
was a group of Monsieur Le Voiser's pupils
there, whom Jack Towns, borrowing his text
from the circus posters, called "A bevy of
beauty and galaxy of grace." They were there
under command of their matron to testify to
the facts of the burglary and the identity of
the burglar, which they one and all did with
so much confidence that Jack Towns found it
impossible to shake their beliefs in the smallest
degree.
</p>

<p>
Sam Anderson was there too, very reluctantly
indeed and under compulsion of a subpœna.
The Commonwealth's Attorney had
somehow learned of his encounter with Westover
near the scene of the burglary under what
appeared to be suspicious circumstances. The
hotel clerk was present to testify concerning
the hour and circumstances of Westover's return
to the hotel on the night before.
</p>

<p>
To meet all this array of testimony, Boyd
Westover had no single witness of any kind.
And if there had been any such Jack Towns
would not have put him on the stand. It was
clear that the accused young man must be
committed in any case to await the action of
the Grand Jury, and Jack Towns was much too
shrewd a lawyer to waste strength&mdash;if he had
had any strength&mdash;in this preliminary hearing.
He devoted himself instead to the task
of getting the bail fixed at as low a sum as
possible. When he pleaded that his client was
well known to be a gentleman of the best family
connections and the most scrupulous honor,
a man to whom the commission of such a crime
was utterly impossible, the magistrate reminded
him that the witnesses were young
gentlewomen of equally good families, in
whom perjury was not even conceivable; that
their number was too great and their testimony
too positive to leave room for the theory of
possible mistake; and finally that the very fact
of Boyd Westover's high place in life rendered
any crime on his part especially heinous. He
felt bound, he said, to fix bail at five thousand
dollars&mdash;a very great sum in those days.
</p>

<p>
Within the hour, however, Boyd's friends
and those who had been friends of his father,
rallied about him, ready and eager to furnish
bonds for any amount. Not one of them knew
aught of the merits of the case, and not one of
them asked a question concerning it. They
simply did not believe that Boyd Westover
had broken by night into a girls' school for
any purpose whatever, and they were determined
that he should not go to jail while
awaiting indictment and trial on so absurd a
charge.
</p>

<p>
"Now come with me," said Jack Towns as
soon as the matter of the bail bonds was settled.
"We'll go to my house, not to my office,
to avoid interruptions. I must get at the very
marrow of this matter before a word is said
about it. Come."
</p>

<p>
When the two were seated in an untidy
room of Jack Towns's untidy bachelor establishment,
and Jack had locked the front door
for the first time within his recollection, he
turned to his friend, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I want you to tell me every thing you did
last night&mdash;the unimportant things even more
than the important. Don't be afraid of boring
me with details, and relate everything in
the order in which it occurred. Then I'll cross-examine
you as rigidly as if you were a witness
concealing something. Perhaps we may
discover something to shed light upon what
seems the most perplexing mystery I ever
knew. Go on."
</p>

<p>
Boyd told the story in minute detail, ending
it by saying:
</p>

<p>
"I can make oath to all that and swear that
nothing else of any kind occurred."
</p>

<p>
"No, you can't," said Jack Towns. "The
court won't let you swear to any of it."
</p>

<p>
"Can I not make a statement of facts in a
case that involves my liberty, my reputation,
and everything else that I care for?"
</p>

<p>
"No. The law of Virginia does not permit
an accused person to testify in his own behalf.
That is the Common Law rule, and Virginia
is under the Common Law. Don't tell
me the thing is absurd, unjust, cruel, barbaric,
and all that; for I know it already. It is the
law, and you and I cannot change it. Let us
go on with our inquiry instead. Do you know
approximately at what hour you passed Le
Voiser's school on your return from your visit
to Milhauser?"
</p>

<p>
"I know exactly. It was precisely half-past
twelve. I saw lights carried about in the
school and, wondering at the fact, looked at
my watch to see the hour."
</p>

<p>
"And you left Milhauser's house at what
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Half-past ten."
</p>

<p>
"Why did it take you so long to get back
to the hotel?"
</p>

<p>
"Milhauser's house, as you know, is away
out of town&mdash;beyond Richmond College.
There's a horse car which runs at irregular
intervals between the college and the Broad
Street end of the Fredericksburg Railroad,
using the track of that railroad when no train
is due. When I got to the college gate it was
raining heavily and I took shelter under a sort
of shed opposite the gates to wait for the car.
It didn't come, and at last I decided to walk
on."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you turn south and into Grace
Street, instead of coming on down Broad?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it was raining and muddy, and the
sidewalks are better in Grace Street. Besides,
as my hotel is in Main Street I had to turn
south at some point on the journey."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course."
</p>

<p>
After a period of silent thinking to no purpose,
Jack Towns said:
</p>

<p>
"It's a queer case. All those girls swear
you were in the school a little after twelve.
Milhauser, if questioned, would have to swear
that you left his house at half-past ten. You
saw nobody else after that, who could even
suggest an alibi. You got to the hotel drenched
and dripping, at precisely the time you would
have got there if you had been chased out of
the school at the time the intruder was. You
admit that you passed the school at the time
of the disturbance. The case is so clearly made
out against you, both by the positive testimony
of eyewitnesses, and by all the circumstances,
that any jury ever empanelled would have to
convict you. Why, I'd feel bound to convict
you myself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you have the remotest
shadow of doubt as to my innocence of this
charge?" sternly demanded Westover, rising.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not. Don't be an idiot. Sit
down. But as the case stands we haven't a
straw to cling to. We can't impeach the testimony
of a dozen high-bred young women,
every one of whom swears positively that she
knows you well and that she saw you make
your escape from the invaded precincts. There
is no way in which we can so much as cast a
doubt upon your guilt. With the case presented
as it stands, any juror who should
hesitate to pronounce you guilty would be a
perjurer. The only hope is that we may
find some way out before the case comes to
trial."
</p>

<p>
"When will that be?" asked Boyd Westover,
in a tone so stoically calm that Jack
Towns looked at him to see what had happened
to him.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ill?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, not at all. It is only that I see the
utter hopelessness of the case. I am a man
condemned to worse than death. But I am a
<i>man</i> and must face even such calamity without
flinching. When the trial is over, I shall be
a convicted felon. It will do no good to assert
my innocence. Nobody will believe it&mdash;nobody
can, in face of the testimony. My life
is ruined, my reputation blasted, my doom
sealed. But I shall neither whine nor whimper.
Now tell me when the blow is to fall?
When will the trial occur?"
</p>

<p>
"The court is in session now. The indictment
will be found to-morrow, but I shall secure
a postponement of the trial until the next
term."
</p>

<p>
"Do nothing of the kind. Let the trial
come on at once&mdash;the sooner the better. Delay
will do no sort of good. I believe every
accused person is entitled to 'a speedy trial.'
Demand that for me, and secure it."
</p>

<p>
Towns argued and pleaded, but to no purpose.
He could offer no suggestion of advantage
in delay, except by saying:
</p>

<p>
"I have always found it worth while to trust
to the unexpected. If we have time, something
may happen that we don't anticipate."
</p>

<p>
"And I, in the meantime?" answered Boyd.
"No. Bring the thing to a head at once.
How soon can you make it?"
</p>

<p>
"Within forty-eight hours," answered the
lawyer. "I advise against it, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand. The responsibility
rests upon me. Go on and make an end of the
horrible thing."

<br />
IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
</h3>

<p>
It was the chivalric custom of the Virginians
to protect their woman-kind in all circumstances,
at all costs and at all hazards,
not only against wrong and danger, but equally
against annoyance and especially the annoyance
of publicity. Women in Virginia were
proudly feminine; men intensely and bravely
masculine.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly the news of Boyd Westover's
case had only begun to spread abroad when all
the male relatives of all the girls in Le Voiser's
school set themselves to hurry their daughters,
sisters and nieces into secure hiding, so that
they might be spared the annoyance of appearing
in court as witnesses in a criminal case.
</p>

<p>
Short as the time was, the officers sent to
serve summonses upon such as were wanted
found the school well nigh deserted. Some
even of those on whom they succeeded in serving
their subpœnas were protectingly abducted
before the day of the trial by relatives who
braved the penalties of contempt of court in
rescue of delicately nurtured maidens dear to
them.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless there were one or two of the
girls present in court when Boyd Westover
was called to the bar. These had been in hiding,
but their places of concealment had been
discovered and the girls themselves brought by
force to the court. Then too the matron was
there prepared to bear unhesitating witness to
Boyd's identity with the offender.
</p>

<p>
A good deal of time was consumed in securing
a jury. The first man called declared:
</p>

<p>
"I would not believe this charge against
Boyd Westover even if I had been present, seeing
him with my own eyes." Others expressed
their incredulity in different forms of
words but with equal positiveness, and of
course all such were rejected. It thus happened
that the jury was not completed till a
late hour in the day. But on the other hand
it took very little time for the Commonwealth's
witnesses to give their testimony, and after
one or two fruitless attempts to secure from
them an admission of doubt or possible mistake,
Jack Towns forbore to cross examine
them.
</p>

<p>
He had no witnesses to offer in his client's
behalf. He had nothing to depend upon indeed
except a certain persuasive eloquence
which had often served him well, and this he
brought to bear with all his passionate nature
to stimulate it. He spoke for an hour. He
argued, pleaded, persuaded. He set forth the
character of his client and of the distinguished
family from which he was sprung. He dwelt
upon the utter improbability of the commission
of such a crime by such a man. He
pointed out and emphasized the fact that a
girls' school was not the place that any housebreaker
in his senses would think of entering
in search of booty. He ended with an impassioned
setting forth of the ruin and disgrace
that must fall upon this high-charactered
young man as the result of an adverse verdict.
So eloquently and so pathetically did he present
the pitiful aspect of the matter that tears
ran down scores of cheeks, and the Judge himself
bowed his head upon the desk in front of
the bench, as if to conceal an emotion he could
not control.
</p>

<p>
The Commonwealth's Attorney&mdash;the prosecuting
officer&mdash;rose, but instead of making
the usual speech, simply said, in a voice choked
with sobs:
</p>

<p>
"The testimony is before you, gentlemen of
the jury. I have nothing to add to it."
</p>

<p>
There was but one result possible. Ten
minutes after the jury retired, it filed into
court again bearing a verdict of "Guilty."
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover was a convicted felon. The
sun of his fair young life had gone down amid
clouds of black disgrace, and it could know no
rising. Worse than death a thousand fold,
worse than the cruelest torture was this to a
proudly sensitive nature, nurtured in traditions
of honor that held every slightest character
stain to be an indelible blot.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was with head erect, with dry eyes,
with unshaken nerves and unflinching spirit
that he met this decree of doom. It was the
tradition of his race to meet Fate without faltering,
to fight while the possibility of fighting
lasted, and when it failed, to shroud an undaunted
soul in the chain mail of unconquerable
courage.
</p>

<p>
When the verdict was rendered, the young
man turned to his friend and counsellor, and
in an entirely unemotional voice, said:
</p>

<p>
"I thank you sincerely for all you have
done and tried to do. I have need of a little
time in which to arrange my affairs. Can
you do me a final favor by securing it for
me?"
</p>

<p>
The matter was easily arranged. The Judge,
full of compassion for the ruined youth, and
in spite of reason, testimony, and everything
else, still not believing in Boyd Westover's
guilt, asked if ten days would suffice. Then
without renewing the bail bonds that had expired
with the beginning of the trial, he appointed
the tenth day thereafter for sentence.
It was the Commonwealth's Attorney's business
to move for the renewal of the bonds,
without which the condemned man was in fact
under no restraint whatever, but he made no
motion of the kind. When asked by Jack
Towns some time afterwards why he had not
done his duty in that respect, he replied:
</p>

<p>
"I simply couldn't. Boyd Westover and I
were schoolmates, you know, and I lived for
many months in his father's house. I <i>knew</i> he
wouldn't run away. Who ever heard of a
Westover flinching? Why should I subject
him to an indignity?"
</p>

<p>
Thus, in Virginia, did character&mdash;personal
and inherited&mdash;count. There were some
things that a gentleman could not do. He
might commit a crime of violence, but he could
not do a cowardly or treacherous act. The
bailiff who had trusted Boyd Westover's word
of honor, knew that and risked the loss of his
place upon his confidence in it. The Commonwealth's
Attorney knew it and took the chance
of impeachment upon it.
</p>

<p>
The net result was that on the day of his
conviction Boyd Westover walked out of
court an absolutely free man except in so far
as he was bound by his own sense of honor
and by the traditions of the race from which
he was sprung. These bound him to appear
in court for sentence at the end of the ten days
allowed to him, and as everybody knew, the
bond was amply sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Jack Towns took him in the meanwhile to
his own house.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be my guest," he said, "and I'll
see that we aren't interrupted."
</p>

<p>
"You still don't mind that?" Boyd asked.
</p>

<p>
For response he got an earnest look in the
eyes, and the verbal answer:
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool, Boyd."
</p>

<p>
After a minute, Boyd asked, reflectively:
</p>

<p>
"How is it, Jack, that you and some others
seem still to believe in me? In view of the
evidence&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hang the evidence," interrupted the lawyer.
"Don't you know that character is the
most important and the most trustworthy fact
in life? You don't suppose for a moment that
I have a doubt in your case, do you? If
you do, you grievously wrong my friendship."
</p>

<p>
"How then do you account for the facts as
set forth in the testimony against me?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Boyd? Are you trying
to convince me that you are guilty of a
crime that I know to be utterly impossible to
you?"
</p>

<p>
"No. I am only trying to find out the
grounds of your confidence in me, so that I
may know how far to impose on them in making
my arrangements for the future. That's
the purport of my question, which, by the way,
you haven't answered yet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, as to that, you're the victim of
some hideous mistake. If you had let me stave
off your trial for six months the chances are we
should have found out what the mistake is.
As it is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As it is, I couldn't have lived for six
months in such suspense as that. Neither
could you, in like case. We're the sort of men
who say to the lightning, 'Strike if you will,
but don't prolong your threats.' Besides, I
cannot see how this thing could have been
bettered by delay. Those girls honestly believe
they recognized me as an intruder in the school.
They would believe that quite as firmly six
months hence as now."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so. But six months hence not one
of them would have been in Virginia to testify
against you. Their friends would have taken
care of that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. And I should have been suspected
of securing my acquittal by spiriting
away the witnesses against me. I couldn't live
under so black a shadow as that."
</p>

<p>
"I understand. But all this is profitless.
We have much to do to get your affairs in
order. Let us address ourselves to that. First
of all I've had all your mail sent up here from
the hotel. Suppose you read it now, and after
supper we'll set to work."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<br />
THE SHADOWS FALL
</h3>

<p>
When the shadows begin to fall upon
a human life, they fall quickly and
darkly.
</p>

<p>
In Boyd Westover's mail was a letter from
the agent who had arranged the mortgage
loan upon Wanalah plantation, threatening to
abandon the arrangement on the ground that
young Westover's conviction impaired the security.
This sorely troubled Boyd Westover&mdash;for
if he was to go to prison his mother's
financial ease was a matter of primary concern
to him. It didn't trouble Jack Towns in the
least.
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me for answer," the lawyer
said, taking possession of the letter. "The
man ought to seek employment as an oyster-opener
at Rockett's. That's about his size.
That mortgage is completely executed. I've
seen to it, pending&mdash;other things. That will
stand, and, as the property is amply good for
it, the fellow's an idiot to want to fly his bargain."
</p>

<p>
There was news in the next mail that could
not be so lightly dismissed. The family physician
wrote that Boyd's mother, already in
feeble and precarious health, had been shocked
by the tidings of her son's calamity into a condition
that threatened the worst. This calamity
was one which even Boyd Westover's stoicism
could not face without flinching. From
childhood his affection for his mother had been
a dominant passion, and since his father's death
it had become fatherly as well as filial. He
had jealously guarded that "little mother," as
he called her, against every shock, every care,
every breath of an adverse wind as it were.
He had made a veritable pet of her, and while
never for a moment laying aside his chivalric
respect and reverence, he had added to them
a certain big brotherly manner in which she
had found joy untellable. If she wearied while
walking with him in the house grounds, he
would pick her up, as he might have done with
any child, and in spite of her laughing protests,
carry her into the porch and deposit her
in a hammock. If a light shone disagreeably
in her eyes he discovered it and shut it off
before she became conscious of its glare. If
she went to her room to rest he quietly stationed
a maid at the foot of the stairs with
orders to permit no noise and no passing up or
down.
</p>

<p>
Now that news came of this dearly loved little
mother's serious illness, the young man was
made to suffer agonies by the consciousness
that her affliction was on his account, so that
it required all of Jack Towns's eloquence to
convince him that he was himself in nowise to
blame for it. By way of emphasizing that,
the young lawyer had to put the matter into
brutally plain phrase.
</p>

<p>
"If you were guilty of the crime of which
you have been convicted, and for which you
will have to serve a term in state's prison, you
would do well to scourge your soul with a
whip of scorpions for your sin against the
mother who bore you. As you are innocent
of that and of all other crimes you have no
right to hold yourself responsible for the consequences
of other people's mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"Am I free to go to my mother while she
yet lives?" Boyd asked in an agony of apprehension.
</p>

<p>
Then Jack Towns lied&mdash;like the generous
gentleman he was.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said. "Legally you are free to
go anywhere you please&mdash;to Mozambique or
the dominions of Mumbo Jumbo if you choose.
But you are free only because of the generous
confidence of the Judge and the Commonwealth's
Attorney in your honor as a gentleman.
You are bound by that honor not to
leave Richmond during the days granted
you."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact Jack Towns had in his
possession a letter addressed to him by the
Westover family physician in which were
written these words:
</p>

<p>
"Whatever else happens, for heaven's sake
don't let Boyd come home now. The shock
of seeing him would kill his mother out of
hand."
</p>

<p>
But Jack Towns was a lawyer and he found
a better way of putting the matter by way of
accomplishing his purpose.
</p>

<p>
Still another thing darkened the young
man's way. It was not because of news, but
because of no news at all.
</p>

<p>
There was no line in any of his mails from
Margaret Conway, the woman he loved with
all his soul, the woman who had plighted her
troth to him in the impassioned words he so
well remembered:
</p>

<p>
"I am not a woman to love lightly or lightly
to forget. Love seems to me a holy thing, and
to trifle with it a blasphemy. I have given you
my love, Boyd, and there is no power in all the
universe that can make me take it back. Even
you could not do that. Nothing you might
do&mdash;even if it were crime itself&mdash;could alter
the fact that my love is all yours, now and
forever."
</p>

<p>
Upon reflection, he absolved Margaret from
blame, and with good reason. Upon his first
accusation he had not written to her at all in
supplement to the love letter of that night.
He had regarded the whole matter as a thing
preposterous, which a hearing in the magistrate's
court would promptly dissipate into thin
air, and it had been his kindly thought not to
tell her of the absurd accusation until he could
tell her also of the ridiculous end made of it
at a court hearing. When at last the matter
had assumed a serious aspect he had written
her a letter in which he had asserted his innocence
but without protesting it in any impassioned
way. To that he had added:
</p>

<p>
"Of course if I am a man of honor I am
bound to offer you a release from the engagement
between us, while if I am not an honorable
man but the criminal I am accused of being,
you are free to take your release without
permission from me."
</p>

<p>
A calculation showed that if that letter had
reached its destination when it should, and if
an answer had been sent by the first returning
mail, he should now have the reply. But mails
were slow and uncertain in those days and The
Oaks lay far up near the Blue Ridge and seven
miles from the post office. It might easily have
happened that his letter to Margaret had not
reached her as soon as it should; or that the
shock of it might have unfitted her to reply
immediately; or that her answer might have
been delayed in transmission. All these were
possibilities, and they comforted the young
man.
</p>

<p>
But as the days went by and still no letter
came from Margaret the comfort became less
and less, until at last he despaired and summoned
his stoicism to his relief.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I have expected her to write
to me?" he asked himself. "What obligation
can she owe to a convicted criminal? I was
a fool to look for a letter. I must bear my
burden alone. I must meet my fate with a
calm mind."
</p>

<p>
Then another thought came to him.
</p>

<p>
"I am living in a fool's paradise. Jack
Towns professes still to believe in me, and
perhaps he does. But how can I expect anybody
else to do so? In view of the testimony
against me, there is no room or reason for
doubt of my guilt in any sane mind. I must
recognize that and face it with what courage
I can. I am a convicted criminal, and I must
expect everybody to regard me as such. I
must go through my life with that brand upon
my brow. There is an end of hope for me.
I must simply endure."
</p>

<p>
It was characteristic of him that in all this
melancholy meditation, no thought of suicide
entered his mind. He had from his youth up
held his life in readiness for sacrifice in any
worthy behalf. There was never a time when
he would not have given it as a forfeit in behalf
of those he loved, never a time when he
would not have laid it down gladly in answer
to any call of duty. But the cowardly thought
of destroying it by way of himself escaping
from intolerable sufferings did not suggest itself
to his brave young soul. It is a man's
part to endure what comes to a man, and Boyd
Westover was altogether a man.
</p>

<p>
He remembered Margaret's impassioned
promise, and he doubted not the sincerity of
her soul in giving it. But he absolved her
now and accepted the result as part and parcel
of the strangely bewildering Fate that had
overtaken him.
</p>

<p>
To that effect he wrote to her on the night
before the day appointed for his sentencing.
On that day had come to him the crushing
news of his mother's death, and very bitterly
he had felt the cruelty of a fate that forbade
him even to go home to bury his dead.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Margaret:
</p>

<p>
"I find that I have been expecting some
letter from you in reply to my late one. I
realize that I had neither right nor reason to
expect anything of the kind. I am a convicted
criminal, convicted upon testimony so conclusive
that no sane person can doubt its truth.
To-morrow morning I shall be sentenced.
You can have no relations with me. You can
bear me no duty of any kind. It is only to
say this that I write to you now, to say that I
hold you absolved from any and all obligations
toward me, and that I shall live and die cherishing
in full measure my faith in your loyalty
and truth. You are never to let a doubt of
that vex your mind."
</p>

<p>
With that he finally banished all thought of
his past life, its joys, its sorrows, its aspirations
and its apprehensions, from his mind.
</p>

<p>
"How long a sentence will they give me,
Jack?" he asked his lawyer.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know. The shortest, probably, or
very nearly the shortest that the law allows;
not over two years at any rate."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it doesn't matter," Boyd answered.
"Two minutes or two years of shame
are all one to a sensitive man, and as for the
'hard labor,' I'm strong and well. I probably
shall not find it interesting to grind stove lids
or do whatever else the prison authorities set
me at, but at any rate the work will occupy the
time and prevent me from thinking too deeply.
It will tire me, too, so that I shall sleep of
nights."
</p>

<p>
Jack Towns found nothing to say by way of
reply, and he said nothing. Presently Boyd
drew a package of papers from his pocket and
passed it over to the man he regarded as the
one friend left him in all the world now.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you'd better look into that," he
said. "It may help Wanalah out of difficulty.
I don't know. The thing came in my mail a
week ago, but it didn't interest me then and
I slipped it into my pocket and forgot all about
it. No, don't bother with it now. Read it
later. Just now I have something else to talk
to you about. You've promised to look after
my affairs while I'm in prison, and there's one
thing I want to ask you. Don't let the overseer
at Wanalah work the servants too hard.
There is no need. With only ordinary crops
the plantation can easily carry its load now,
and I don't want the people there overworked.
See to it please. Now if you don't mind, I'm
going to bed. To-morrow night I'll lie in a
cell."
</p>

<p>
With that the young man withdrew, and
after half an hour of sad gazing at the moonlight
that streamed in through the window,
Jack Towns turned up the gas and set to work
reading the papers that had failed to interest
their owner. They interested Jack Towns
amazingly, and he had no sooner finished the
reading of them than he hurried unceremoniously
into Boyd's room, and shaking him said:
</p>

<p>
"Here, get up. This thing must be attended
to immediately. There are papers to
be drawn and executed at once. So hustle into
some clothes quick."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<br />
THE COURAGE OF WOMANHOOD
</h3>

<p>
When rumors came to The Oaks of
Boyd Westover's trouble, Margaret
Conway's first impulse was to drive
over to Wanalah and comfort Boyd's mother
with assurances that there could be no truth in
the reports. Margaret had always cherished a
very tender affection for Mrs. Westover, and
during the brief time since her love had been
pledged to Boyd, she had found that affection
rapidly taking upon itself the character of a
girl's tenderness for her mother. Having
never known a mother of her own, the girl
was quick to make herself a daughter in affection
where she was presently to become a
daughter in law and in fact. She drove every
day to Wanalah and spent loving hours there
with the gentle invalid who had so warmly
welcomed her daughterly love.
</p>

<p>
But when the evil news of Boyd's conviction
came and Margaret planned to go earlier
than usual to Wanalah, Colonel Conway objected.
</p>

<p>
"You will only distress yourself and afflict
her," he said. "This thing will be your only
topic of conversation, and what can either of
you say that will bring comfort to the other?"
</p>

<p>
"I can tell her I love her and that I loyally
believe in Boyd," answered the girl with all
the pride of her race in her voice and attitude.
</p>

<p>
"But how can you say that, daughter, in
face of the evidence?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't evidence&mdash;it's merely testimony.
The evidence lies in Boyd Westover's character
and it flatly contradicts the testimony. The
testimony is false; the evidence is subject to
no possible question. I'm sorry you don't see
it so, Father."
</p>

<p>
The old man paced the floor for a space and
then answered:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I do see it so. I'd like to, at any
rate; I'm strongly disposed to give the young
man the benefit of the doubt, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any doubt," interjected the
passionate girl with vehemence. "There isn't
any doubt, and I shall quarrel even with you,
Father, if you suggest such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Be calm, my child," pleaded the old man
placatively. "Perhaps you are right. I'm disposed
to take your view&mdash;strongly so. But
there's your Aunt Betsy, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. She's the only human being
you were ever afraid of, Father. But you're
afraid of her as everybody else is&mdash;everybody
but me. I don't know why."
</p>

<p>
"But your Aunt Betsy presents the matter
in a way that must be considered. She
says&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know what she says," interrupted the
overwrought girl. "She has said it all to me,
over and over again. She urges the conventions&mdash;the
cowardly shams and falsities of
our artificial life. She talks of 'what people
will say,' as if it made any difference what
people say when we know we are doing right.
You <i>know</i> that Boyd Westover is an honorable
man, just as I know it. If you hadn't been
afraid of Aunt Betsy, you'd have done your
duty like a man; you'd have gone to Boyd's
side. You'd have stood by him in his hour
of need&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Margaret, what good would that have
done in face of the evidence or the testimony,
for I agree with you that there's a difference?"
</p>

<p>
"It would have strengthened and encouraged
him with the assurance that one brave
man at least knew his character and was ready
to face calumny with an assertion of his confidence.
But you were afraid of Aunt Betsy.
It is the only cowardice I ever knew you to be
guilty of. She talks of placing 'blots on our
escutcheon'&mdash;as if we had an escutcheon,
whatever that sort of thing may be; I tell you
the worst blot of all was made by your failure
to go to Richmond and stand by Boyd in his
undeserved trouble. You played the part of a
coward there. Pardon me if my words are
harsh. I feel them and mean them. Now I
am going to Wanalah. I, at least, will do my
part as a descendant of a brave race, if all the
demons of perdition stand in the way."
</p>

<p>
With that the girl moved proudly out of the
house, mounted the horse that a negro held
waiting for her, and rode away.
</p>

<p>
She did not return until after the funeral at
Wanalah, which her father and her aunt attended,
and when she returned, her attitude
was one of stately reserve which appalled her
father and "grieved" her aunt.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile she had written every day
a loyal letter to Boyd Westover.
</p>

<p>
Not one of those letters ever reached him.
Nor did any of his letters come to her. Aunt
Betsy had deemed it her "duty to the family"
to see to that, and Aunt Betsy prided herself
upon doing her duty, no matter how disagreeable
it might be&mdash;to others.
</p>

<p>
But the failure of the missives left Margaret
in sorely distressing perplexity. Why did not
Boyd write to her? Why did he not take her
into his confidence? Especially why did he not
respond, in some way, to her repeated avowals
of splendid loyalty and confidence?
</p>

<p>
She could not understand. She could not
even inquire. She could only mourn.

THE PACKET OF PAPERS
</h3>

<p>
Jack Towns was accustomed to have
about him whatever there was that could
make his hard-working life comfortable,
if any reasonable expenditure of money could
secure it. And he interpreted the words
"reasonable expenditure," in that connection,
rather liberally. His income was large and he
had nobody anywhere dependent upon him.
Accordingly he was one of the two or three
self-indulgent men in Richmond at that time,
who possessed a set bath tub with water taps
running into it and a showering apparatus
above.
</p>

<p>
When he roused his friend that night, after
hurriedly running through the packet of papers,
he was full of an eagerness and enthusiasm
which the other did not seem to share.
Boyd Westover was sleepy, and worse still, in
his present case, he was indifferent. What
good could a packet of papers or anything else
bring to a man disgraced, condemned, doomed
to a life of lost repute? He heartily wished
that Jack had kept the papers and done whatever
he pleased with them after the closing of
the prison doors behind himself on the approaching
day. But in response to Jack's insistence,
he arose, drew on a light dressing
gown and slippers, and offered his dully uninterested
presence in Jack's dining room.
4
Promptly recognizing his condition of mind,
Jack took matters into his own hands, after a
masterful habit he had. He seized Boyd by
the elbow and led him into the bath room.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said; "lay off your gown and
pull your toes out of those slippers. Hop into
the tub and I'll wake you up."
</p>

<p>
At the next instant the cold shower descended
upon the young man's head and person,
and Jack continued his chatter.
</p>

<p>
"Now you're awake, rub yourself down and
come into the dining room. I've got to have
you awake and you and I are going to work
all night. I've sent Dick for half a hundred
oysters and a dozen bottles of cold ale, and
later he'll make black coffee for us. Hurry up
now, and 'do try to be interested' as a bashful
friend of mine said to a girl when he was
about to propose to her."
</p>

<p>
As he left the bath room abruptly, Boyd
made no reply until he joined the lawyer in the
dining room where the papers from the packet
lay spread out in the order in which they were
to be taken up for consideration. Then he
said:
</p>

<p>
"I will try to be interested, Jack; for your
sake I'll do my best. But what interest can
a man in my position feel in anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Now listen to me, Boyd!" Jack Towns
said commandingly, and rising to his feet to
say it. "Listen to me. You are morbid. You
need calomel or something. You're the victim
of some mistake and you're in sore trouble.
But you are not disgraced. Nobody can
disgrace a man but the man himself. You
are conscious of your own honor; what matters
it what others think? Besides, no honest
man in Virginia believes that you are
guilty of a sneaking crime or capable of it.
The jury that convicted you didn't believe it
and not one of them believes it now. The
Judge who will sentence you doesn't believe it.
If the envious and malignant falsely pretend
to believe it, why should you care for the despicable
pretense of people so utterly unworthy?
If cowards fight shy of your acquaintance,
lest recognition of you should compromise
themselves, why should you care for the
acquaintance of such poltroons? You are
Westover of Wanalah&mdash;inheritor of an honorable
name. You will be that so long as you
shall live. It behoves you to bear that name
with head erect and with contempt alone for
those who do not recognize your worthiness
to bear it. This affair is an unfortunate incident.
It will soon be over, and you will have
a lifetime before you in which to teach men
the falsity of the accusation against you.
There. My lecture is done. Let us get to
these papers. They hold great news for you."
</p>

<p>
When the two were seated, Jack took up a
letter, which was first of the papers in the
order of consideration.
</p>

<p>
"This is from a firm of lawyers, Dodge,
Denslow and Deming of Denver&mdash;charmingly
alliterative throughout&mdash;do you happen
to know who they are?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in a way. There was a memorandum
among my father's papers, that mentioned
them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on. What did it say, or reveal,
or suggest? This is business, Boyd. Put
your thinking machine on it."
</p>

<p>
"I will,&mdash;to oblige you, Jack. The memorandum
catalogued a long list of mining lands
and mining claims somewhere up in the Rocky
Mountains or in some side issue of a range&mdash;you'll
find the paper in my desk at home&mdash;lands
and claims which my father had bought
during one of his journeys out that way and
had placed in my name, as a provision for me
in case of accident."
</p>

<p>
"That accounts for these papers being in
your name and not your father's," interrupted
Jack. "I was puzzled by that. But go on.
I want to hear all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know my father was an optimist&mdash;a
dreamer almost&mdash;and he was possessed
of an idea, reflected in the memorandum, that
these things would make the future Westover
of Wanalah&mdash;myself or my son if I should
have one&mdash;enormously rich. As nearly as I
could make out, the multitudinous lands and
mining claims he bought in my name covered
a large area of entirely untillable and not very
accessible land somewhere up in the high
mountains, where grub-staked miners scratched
the surface for silver ore, with now and then
a little find of gold. They worked on shares
somehow, and this law firm collected my share
from time to time and remitted it. It was so
small a part of the assets of the estate that I've
forgotten how much it was. That's all I know
of Dodge, Denslow &amp; Deming."
</p>

<p>
"You're likely to know a good deal more
about them hereafter," said Jack, "if I can
awaken in your mind a reasonable interest in
a matter that promises to make you the richest
man in Virginia, twice or thrice over."
</p>

<p>
"Cui bono?" responded Boyd. "When my
prison term ends I shall have enough, without
that, to feed me, and I've nobody else to
feed."
</p>

<p>
"Boyd Westover, if you go on in that mood,
I'll chuck you into the bath tub again and set
the shower going without giving you a chance
to shed your clothes. Can't you see that when
you&mdash;when&mdash;well, when present difficulties
are over, this thing will give you an interest
in life, something to occupy your mind, something
to manage and&mdash;oh, I forgot, you don't
know the facts yet. It appears from these
papers&mdash;we won't bother now to read them
in detail&mdash;that the mining lands your father
bought in your name, have proved to be about
the richest in the world. They cover practically
all of one of the richest deposits of gold,
silver, lead, and quicksilver, ever discovered.
Listen. This is the way Jake Greenfield puts
it in a letter. Jake seems to be a shrewd Yankee
whom your lawyers have established on
the lands to watch operations and prevent trespass.
He writes to the lawyers:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'I don't s'pose Mr. Westover nor you
neither's got a krect idee of what he's got up
here. It's like an injun's blanket, with fringes
all round it. He's got the blanket an' these
fellers what's opened up mines north an' south
of him has got the fringes. Nachurly they's
a tryin' to git in under the blanket, but I'm a
watchin' out an' they're a doin' no trespassin'.
They's got the fence corners an' Mr. Weststover's
got the field. They's plannin' to buy
him out an' they's got experts an' engineers an'
lawyers enuff here to run a ship or an orphan
asylum. My say to Mr. West Stover is don't
bargain with 'em till you know for yourself.
That used to be our way in Varmont, whare I
come from. This is my wink to a blind hoss,
an' a nod with it.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The lawyers seem to have taken Jake
Greenfield's counsel seriously, so far at least
as to send experts of their own to study the
situation, and these seem to confirm Jake's
judgment. So do these other letters, from the
mining men who want to buy you out. I'll
read them."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you summarize them in your own
words, Jack?" interrupted Boyd. "The thing
doesn't greatly interest me, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, listen then, and perhaps I can
awaken your interest. These people it appears
are amply backed by New York and Boston
bankers. In fact the bankers really constitute
the company, and they seem to know their own
minds. They have spent some hundreds of
thousands in setting up machinery and all that
sort of thing, and they say their mining operations
are paying heavy dividends&mdash;twenty-five
or thirty per cent. on their investment.
But the richest leads or lodes or veins or whatever
they are called, lie beneath your land.
You've got the blanket and they only the
fringe, as Jake picturesquely puts it. They
want to buy the blanket, or get in under it
somehow, and they're prepared to pay for what
they want. They propose to organize a new
company to work the whole thing; they to
put in their plant, their costly machinery, their
mining privileges and all their other assets, and
you to put in your mineral lands. They make
you a flat offer of nine hundred thousand dollars
in money, and thirty-nine per cent. of the
stock of the new company, if you will join
them in this project by ceding your lands, mining
rights, etc., to the joint concern. Perhaps
they can be induced to do better even than
that, as they seem very eager, but that is what
they offer to begin with. It means fabulous
wealth to you if their hopes as to the profits
of the new company are measurably fulfilled,
and even if they are not fulfilled at all it means
that you can wear Wanalah plantation as a
watch charm for all your life to come. Isn't
that a fine prospect?"
</p>

<p>
Jack was disappointed in Boyd's reply. He
had hoped that this startling happening might
awaken his friend to a new interest in life and
life's affairs, but, after swallowing two oysters
and slowly sipping half a glass of ale, the
unfortunate young man said, in a melancholy
tone:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the thing ought to be looked
into. If I were a free man again, I'd make
my way out into those wilds and see what
could be done. As it is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As it is," broke in Jack Towns, "you're
going to execute a sweeping power of attorney
authorizing me to act for you, and I'm going
out there. When you&mdash;well, I mean later,&mdash;you'll
take hold of the thing yourself, and those
hustling fellows out there will wake you up,
if I can't. Go to bed now, if you feel like it.
I'll prepare the power of attorney and you can
execute it at breakfast time. I must say you're
uncommonly bad company."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I am," said Boyd as he shuffled
off to his bedroom.
</p>

<br />
THE EVENTS OF A MORNING
</h3>

<p>
It was with a firm step and with head erect,
and, more significant still, with eyes that
looked straight into other eyes without a
suggestion of flinching, that Boyd Westover
entered the court room on the morning appointed
for the pronouncement of sentence
upon him. Jack Towns, who accompanied
him, thought he had never seen so superb an
exhibition of stoicism as that which Boyd had
given throughout this affair.
</p>

<p>
"But this caps the climax," he said to the
Commonwealth's Attorney, whose drawn features
showed clearly the distress he felt in view
of the duty he had to do in moving that sentence
be pronounced upon his old schoolmate,
his boyhood's comrade, whom he had been
compelled to prosecute and convict of an infamous
crime.
</p>

<p>
"Just look at him," Jack whispered. "For
all that his appearance or his manner could
mean you'd think he had come here to deliver
an oration on some distinguished occasion.
It's simply magnificent!"
</p>

<p>
"It is simply horrible&mdash;my part of it, I
mean," answered the other with a suppressed
groan.
</p>

<p>
There was no further time for conversation.
The moment had come when Boyd Westover
must be called to the bar to receive the sentence
of the court. The Commonwealth's Attorney
made the necessary motion in a voice
that could hardly be heard because of his lack
of control over his organs of speech. The
Judge tried hard to deliver the little address
he had carefully prepared as a means of suggesting
what he could not say&mdash;that in spite
of everything he could not personally regard
Boyd Westover as a man actually guilty of
crime. His voice behaved so badly that after
a futile attempt he gave up the effort to say
anything, except the formal words that condemned
the prisoner to serve a term at hard
labor in the State prison.
</p>

<p>
The term fixed by the sentence was the shortest
that the law allowed, but what comfort was
there in that to a sensitive man like Boyd Westover,
to whom disgrace for half a minute
meant the same thing as disgrace for all time?
It is doubtful that he even grasped the meaning
of the words used in limiting the sentence
to the briefest time allowed.
</p>

<p>
As there were papers to be made out and
signed, Jack Towns and his client sat for a
brief while waiting. Presently there was a
little commotion in the outer corridor and a
moment later a bailiff hurriedly entered and
made his way to the Commonwealth's Attorney,
to whom he whispered excitedly. That
officer asked a brief question or two under his
breath. Then he turned to the court and said,
while all listened with the greatest interest:
</p>

<p>
"If your honor please, something has happened&mdash;something
out of the ordinary, something
important, something which if I am correctly
informed vitally concerns business now
before the court. I ask to be excused for a
few minutes in order that I may learn the facts
and report them to the court."
</p>

<p>
With that, receiving a nod of approval from
the Judge, he withdrew.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone the Judge said:
</p>

<p>
"We may as well save what we can of the
time of waiting. Mr. Clerk, if you have the
papers ready in the Westover case I'll sign
them."
</p>

<p>
They were passed to him and, after he had
signed them, handed over to the sheriff, thus
completing that matter at once.
</p>

<p>
A moment later, the Commonwealth's Attorney
returned, pale to the lips, trembling like
one in an ague fit, and with the muscles about
his mouth twitching in a way that was positively
painful to all who looked at him.
</p>

<p>
In a voice that was hard, metallic, and obviously
controlled only by a supreme effort of
the will, he addressed the court.
</p>

<p>
"There has been a terrible mistake made,"
he said with none of the formalities of speech
usual in addressing a tribunal,&mdash;"a disastrous,
cruel, irreparable mistake, for my share
in which I hide my head in shame as I ask God
and man to pardon me. In convicting and
sentencing Boyd Westover, we have convicted
and sentenced an innocent man. The real culprit
is now in a jury room adjoining this apartment.
He has been caught in a repetition of
the act for which Boyd Westover has been
convicted and sentenced. He has confessed
that he was the offender on the former occasion,
and the committing magistrate before
whom he was brought this morning has
brought him hither to repeat his confession
and to let your honor look upon him. It is
the most phenomenal case of mistaken identity
I ever knew or heard of. Even fiction, with
its limitless license of invention, offers no parallel
that I ever heard of. The resemblance
between this man and Boyd Westover is so
perfect, so startling in its completeness that I
could never have believed it upon any testimony
other than that of my own eyes. I ask
permission to bring the prisoner into court."
</p>

<p>
By this time the court room was packed with
all sorts and conditions of men, for the news
of what had happened during the night before
had spread like wildfire over the city.
</p>

<p>
A minute later the prisoner, who gave his
name as "Dolly Andrews," but admitted that
"Dolly" was short for Adolphus, was brought
to the bar. At the Commonwealth's Attorney's
request, Boyd Westover moved forward
and stood by his side.
</p>

<p>
The two men were precisely alike in size,
form and feature, but strangely unlike in expression.
As Jack Towns put the matter:
"Boyd Westover, being a gentleman, looks
into your eyes when he speaks to you or you
to him; the other fellow looks anywhere but
at you. In the one face there is intelligence,&mdash;in
the other a low cunning; in the one an alert
outlook, in the other a look of morbid introspection.
Still the two men are absolutely
alike in all physical respects&mdash;more alike than
I supposed that even twins could be. I could
myself easily mistake one for the other, and I
don't wonder that a lot of excited school girls,
routed out of bed in the middle of the night
and with only bedroom candles to see by, made
the terrible mistake they did."
</p>

<p>
The problem now was what to do. Fortunately
the committing magistrate was a man of
wise discretion. He presented himself in court
and said to the Judge:
</p>

<p>
"I have not yet committed this man, though
he was caught in the act and has made full
confession, both as to his present offence and
as to the former crime, of which another has
been mistakenly convicted. I have thought it
better to bring him before your honor and ask
you to sit as committing magistrate in the case,
in order that you may yourself hear his confession.
It has seemed to me that this course
was best in aid of justice in another case."
</p>

<p>
After an exchange of dignified compliments,
the Judge, sitting as a committing magistrate,
heard the case. During the preceding night
there had been an alarm of "burglars" in Le
Voiser's school. As before, the matron marshalled
her charges for retreat, but this time
there were two stalwart men on the premises
and awaiting call. Monsieur Le Voiser had
looked out for that, by ordering his furnace
man and his steward to sleep in a room within
convenient call, and when the intruder attempted
to escape they were there to seize and
hold him by physical force.
</p>

<p>
They testified to the facts.
</p>

<p>
Then the culprit repeated the confession he
had already made. He seemed in no way
ashamed, and he did not hesitate. He declared
that it was he, and not Boyd Westover, who
had invaded the school on the former occasion,
and when asked what his motive was, he disclaimed
all purposes of robbery and sought to
justify himself by the solemn declaration:
</p>

<p>
"On both occasions I went there under the
command of the Supreme Being."
</p>

<p>
"Just what do you mean by that?" asked
the Judge, testily.
</p>

<p>
"I am divinely commissioned to marry
Miss&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" commanded the Judge. "Don't
mention the young lady's name. Just say 'a
certain young lady.' We won't have her name
dragged into the case."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said the culprit. "It is only
that I am acting under a divine commission and
have nothing to conceal. I must marry the
young lady in question. I met her in the street
once, and talked to her on the subject. She
mistook me for Boyd Westover, and I thought
it best to use that name in my dealings with
her. You see, Judge, when one is divinely
commissioned to achieve a purpose, details
make no difference."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said the Judge; "omit explanations
and arguments, and tell what happened."
</p>

<p>
"The young lady rejected my addresses.
I was not discouraged by that. I had been
divinely warned to expect it. I wrote her
many notes, but she did not reply to them.
Then I saw my duty clearly. I decided to use
gentle force and carry her away with me,
leaving the divine influence to chasten her
proud spirit and teach her the duty of loving
me. I have been twice defeated in my endeavors.
I shall succeed when the appointed time
is ripe. I must be patient and faithful, that is
all."
</p>

<p>
"After all," whispered Jack Towns to the
Commonwealth's Attorney, "that hysterical
girl who said he had come to abduct her was
right, except in her identification of the man."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but the exception is one of disastrous
consequences. Help me, Towns, to right this
wrong! I'll never do the like again. I'll
never prosecute another case so long as I live.
I've already sent in my resignation from office."
</p>

<p>
"You're a sublimated idiot," said Jack.
"Listen. The Judge is speaking."
</p>

<p>
"I will commit this man to await the action
of the Grand Jury," the Judge said. "In the
meanwhile the Court suggests to the Commonwealth's
Attorney the propriety of asking for
a commission in lunacy to inquire into this
man's sanity."
</p>

<p>
Thus spurred out of the lethargic collapse
into which he had fallen, the official prosecutor
made the necessary motion and the court
promptly appointed the commission.
</p>

<p>
Then Jack Towns arose to ask:
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done to right the wrong in
the case of my client? And more especially,
what is to be done to prevent the aggravation
of that wrong? I call attention to the fact
that the papers committing this obviously innocent
man to the penitentiary are already in
the hands of the sheriff, who has no right to
exercise discretion in the case. In the ordinary
course of events my client, innocent of offence
as he obviously is, must pass the portals of the
prison within the hour. I ask the court to prevent
this crowning wrong in a case in which
enough and too much of wrong has been done
already."
</p>

<p>
The Judge was in full sympathy, but for
order's sake he asked if the Commonwealth's
Attorney desired to be heard in opposition to
the request of the counsel.
</p>

<p>
"Not in opposition," said the official, "but
in full and hearty sympathy. I feel that a
great wrong has been done; I feel this so
strongly that I have sent to the proper authority
my resignation of the office I hold, in order
that I may never again have part or lot in a
wrong so grievous. I earnestly second the request
of the counsel for the prisoner that everything
shall be done which the law permits, to
prevent further wrong and to right the wrong
already done."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said the Judge. "The sheriff
is ordered to return to the clerk the papers in
his possession. The prisoner is paroled in the
custody of his counsel, to await further proceedings.
Unfortunately the court knows of
no process of law by which the fact of this
innocent man's conviction and sentence can be
undone. It is not within the power of man to
make that not to be which has been. The
court cannot undo the proceedings that have
been had in this case. It can only make an
earnest effort to prevent the wrongful results
of those proceedings. To that end I purpose
to go in person before the Governor of the
State to ask for the fullest reparation that can
be made, namely, a pardon&mdash;pardon for a
crime that has not been committed. It seems
almost a mockery, but it is the best that is possible
under the law. In order to give all the
emphasis I can to the proceedings, I shall adjourn
court for a time, and ask the Commonwealth's
Attorney to accompany me on this
mission of justice. Further than that, I direct
him to summon the members of the jury that
convicted Boyd Westover of a crime of which
he is not guilty, to go with us before the Governor
and join us in our request. So far as
the securing of a pardon is concerned, no effort
of this kind is necessary; but the court
deems it proper in this case to make this united
appeal of judge, jury, and prosecutor by way
of emphasizing our recognition of the injustice
done. The court stands adjourned until four
o'clock this afternoon, at which hour Mr.
Boyd Westover"&mdash;the Judge no longer spoke
of him as "the prisoner"&mdash;"will present
himself here and the court will itself deliver
to him&mdash;as it is fitting that the court should
do in such a case&mdash;the papers relieving him,
so far as it is possible now to relieve him, of
all the consequences of a clearly erroneous accusation
and conviction."
</p>

<p>
When the Judge ceased speaking, Boyd
Westover made a profound bow to him, saying
simply: "I thank you." Then turning to
Towns he said:
</p>

<p>
"Come, Jack! I'm faint and hungry. Let's
go to Tom Griffin's and get something to
eat."
</p>

<p>
Tom Griffin's was a place well known in the
Richmond of that old time. Tom himself was
a negro slave who enjoyed vastly more liberty
than any free man of color ever did in Virginia.
Every gentleman in Richmond was his
personal friend; so was every aristocratic
planter east of the Blue Ridge. Any one of
them would have drawn his check in payment
for Tom's liberty, if Tom had desired to be
free. But Tom Griffin wanted nothing of the
kind. He was happy and he knew when he
was well off. If his freedom had been bought,
he must, under the law, have left his native
state, whose people were his friends and whose
associations meant to him all that life could
mean.
</p>

<p>
He knew all there was to know of catering
and of cookery. Better still, as he phrased it,
he "instincted just how to make things good
to eat." He had genius, in short, and the fact
was recognized and celebrated by every man in
Virginia who had a palate and the price&mdash;and
who enjoyed Tom Griffin's favor. For
Tom Griffin's place was no ordinary restaurant.
Men of the common herd were not welcomed
there. Only those whom he recognized as his
friends&mdash;and his friendships were rigidly restricted
to the aristocratic class&mdash;were privileged
to sit at Tom's polished old mahogany
table, and enjoy sora, or canvas backs or terrapin
in perfection. Only such were served
with his glorified chine and spare-ribs, his roast
turkey or his forequarters of spring lamb.
And those who were so privileged could never
be persuaded to believe that anybody else in all
the world could even by accident serve any
viand in such perfection as that in which every
viand came from Tom Griffin's expert hands.
</p>

<p>
Tom probably knew who his master was,
but nobody else ever asked. Tom probably
paid his master a liberal compensation for his
time; he could well afford to do so. For Tom
Griffin was rich&mdash;so rich that many a young
Virginian whose frequent rash expenditures
threatened to involve him in argument with his
father, found relief in a loan from Tom Griffin's
hand, concerning which no papers were
passed. These loans were certain to be repaid.
They were debts of honor, seeing that as a
suitor Tom Griffin&mdash;a negro slave&mdash;would
have had no standing in court.
</p>

<p>
Tom Griffin had waiters in adequate force,
but he never permitted them to serve a gentleman
without his personal superintendence. If
a gentleman wanted a glass of water during
his meal&mdash;as even Virginia gentlemen sometimes
did&mdash;Tom regarded his waiter as a
person competent to serve it. The waiter could
clear away the used crockery, too, and see to it
that lighted wax candles were in place for
cigar-lighting purposes. There were other
minor offices that Tom permitted to his waiters.
But when it came to serving a dish, Tom
took the function upon himself.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he once explained, "the boys is
so stupid. If I've laid myself out to have a
dish just right, I ain't a goin' to spile all my
work by lettin' a clumsy nigger slap-bang it
on the table, like as if he was a sellin' fish in
the market."
</p>

<p>
In accordance with his custom, therefore,
Tom personally served a dinner that Boyd
Westover had not ordered. There were soft
crabs to begin with. There was a whole fore-quarter
of genuine spring lamb for Boyd to
carve at will. There were the earliest peas
of the season, secured by Tom Griffin's "System,"
which consisted in letting all the market
gardeners know that he paid higher prices than
anybody else for the first and best of every
garden's product, and, more important still,
that any gardener failing to give him first
choice would be cut off his list, a proscription
too serious to be faced with composure. There
were the first tomatoes of the season, too, and
there was everything else that was possible,
including a <i>meringe a la créme</i>, black coffee
and cigars at the end.
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover had ordered nothing of the
sort, but Tom Griffin served it all quite as if
he had done so, and when it came upon the
table Tom busied himself and a corkscrew in
opening a dusty, cobwebbed bottle of antique
Madeira, saying as he did so:
</p>

<p>
"Dis is Ann Maria wine, Mas' Boyd, an'
dere ain't much of it left in Old Virginia, I
reckon. Will you 'scuse me ef I say I ain't
paid no attention to your order in gittin' your
dinner ready, an' I ain't asked what sort o'
wine you wanted? De explanation is dat Tom
Griffin is a furnishin' this here dinner an' this
here Ann Maria Madeira, as his contribution
to de joyful occasion. Gentlemen, I trust your
appetites is good."
</p>

<p>
With that Tom withdrew too hastily for
protest or remonstrance. As he went he
snatched a napkin from a vacant table, with
which to dry his dusky cheeks of the tears that
were streaming down them in spite of all his
efforts at self-control.
</p>

<p>
Tom had learned from his customers to
speak fairly correct English, and his lapse into
the negro dialect of his boyhood on this occasion
was the "outward and visible sign of the
inward" emotional disturbance that Boyd
Westover's experience had wrought in his all-affectionate
soul.
</p>

XII
<br />
AFTER THE STORM
</h3>

<p>
Hungry as Boyd Westover had declared
himself to be, and tempting as
was the dinner that Tom Griffin
served, the young man ate with scant appetite,
and when the meal was over his friend was
anxiously worried.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Boyd!" he said. "In view of
all the circumstances you ought to be the jolliest
fellow in Richmond to-day. You've
borne up astonishingly during the real stress
of this affair. Why should you flunk now that
it's all over and you're a victor?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not flunking. I'll never flunk, but
stoicism costs," answered Westover.
</p>

<p>
"Just how do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that my determination to bear a
bold and unflinching front as it becomes a
Westover to do when the penitentiary doors
were yawning for me, with lifelong disgrace
as my portion, has taken more out of me than
you can easily believe. To a man raised in our
traditions, the prospect of disgrace and shame
is a fearful thing to face. A score of agonizing
deaths by torture would have been to me
as nothing in comparison with what I have
suffered in contemplation of this horror. I
have faced the thing as bravely as I could.
That much I owed to my name, my caste, my
lineage&mdash;call it what you will. But my bank
account of endurance is running low now.
My drafts upon it have been heavy and&mdash;well,
there have been no deposits to strengthen
it."
</p>

<p>
He was thinking bitterly of Margaret Conway's
defection.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let us talk of that. I'm as nearly
on the verge of collapse as a healthy man can
be, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"But you are vindicated, and when your
pardon comes this afternoon&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon? Yes. For a crime I did not commit.
Think of it, Jack. From this hour forth
I shall be a man accused, convicted and sentenced
for a crime of infamous character, and
graciously pardoned for it. It couldn't be
worse&mdash;except to my own soul&mdash;if I were
guilty. The pardon undoes nothing but the
punishment. It doesn't wipe out the stain.
It doesn't&mdash;oh, well, you understand. I am
free, but my life is ruined. If I were called
as a witness in court, the opposing attorney
would be free to ask me if I had not been convicted
of a felony and sentenced, and I should
have to answer yes. Then he could forbid
me to explain. The thing is horrible. The
law as it stands is infamously unjust. Why
should I be a pardoned criminal when I have
committed no crime? Why should not the
court that convicted me and sentenced me under
a mistake have power to undo the wrong
by another trial or procedure of some kind?
Why should I not be acquitted of a false accusation
instead of being 'pardoned' for an
offence never committed? No, don't bother
to answer. I know the answer already. Such
cases are too rare for the law to have provided
for them, though it is the law's boast that there
is no wrong for which it doesn't provide a
remedy. However, let's talk of something else.
I'm going off for rest. I suppose this Rocky
Mountain matter ought to be looked after.
Will you go out there as my representative,
under your blanket power of attorney, and do
whatever you think best about it? There
seems to be money enough in it to pay you all
you want in the way of fees, according to
your representation."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go, of course. But I wish you would
go instead, or go with me. It would divert
your mind, and, believe me, Boyd, you need
such diversion more than anything else. Why
can't you go?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I must rest, and because&mdash;well,
because of many things. Never mind. I'm
not going and you are. I'm going a fishing.
Draw up all the necessary papers and I'll execute
them. Can you get them ready to-night?
I want to go away to-morrow morning
and forget."
</p>

<p>
"Where will you go? To Wanalah?"
</p>

<p>
"No; except for brief preparations. To
the mountains. You know I own three or four
high mountain tops up in the Blue Ridge, with
the swales, called valleys, that lie between.
The land is worthless, but the woods up there
are full of game and the brooks alive with
trout. My grandfather bought the vast tract
as an indulgence and my father kept it with
a like purpose. There's a shack of some sort
up there I believe. If not, I can build one in
a half day, and it will interest me to chink and
daub it."
</p>

<p>
Jack Towns sat silent for a time. Then he
said:
</p>

<p>
"I heartily disapprove of your plan. It
means solitude, and you need association with
men to cure you of morbid and unwholesome
feelings."
</p>

<p>
"But I can associate with men only upon
sufferance. You've heard of the person who
said: 'The more I see of men, the better I
like dogs.' I'm not quite of his mind, but anyhow
I'm going up into the high mountains
with my dogs, my guns and my fishing tackle.
So get all the papers ready, Jack, and let me
get away as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
Again, Jack Towns sat silent and troubled.
After awhile he said:
</p>

<p>
"Of course you'll go to my house to-night
and be my guest so long as you remain in
Richmond?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I will if you'll see to it that
no visitors get at me. I want to go to sleep
as soon as this thing's over and I'd like to stay
asleep forever."
</p>

<p>
"You're all wrong, but of course as a guest
in my house you'll be protected from everything
that is reasonably or unreasonably disagreeable
to you. But really, Boyd, the people
who are sure to call to-night&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. They will call to offer congratulations
which are in fact commiserations
and condolences. I don't care to attend my
own funeral in the capacity of chief mourner,
just yet. I shouldn't mind the funeral, with
myself for the corpse, but I'm not prepared to
play the part of chief mourner."
</p>

<p>
"You're morbid, Boyd."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so, but I'm going to become
healthy again. Now listen. I'm going off into
the mountains to match my wits with those
of the wiliest trout, the shyest deer, the most
experienced wild turkey gobblers, and now and
then perhaps to try conclusions with a sly old
bear. By the time I return to civilization, I'll
have decided upon my career. I'm going to do
something&mdash;I don't know what. But by that
time I'll know."
</p>

<p>
"Good! That's the way to look at things.
After all, the strain your stoicism has put upon
you hasn't robbed you of your robust manhood,
and that is what I feared."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Jack, I couldn't lose that and go
on living. It is only that I must have a little
time in which to pull myself together and see
what I can do. If your mission to the Rocky
Mountains proves that those fellows out there
are right, and that a great wealth is ready to
my hand, I may turn philanthropist, or I may
enter upon great business undertakings which
by their employment of multitudes of men at
good wages are perhaps the most philanthropic
of all endeavors. I don't know. I can't think
till I sleep and rest. At any rate while I am
recovering tone up in the high mountains of
the Blue Ridge, you will find out what monetary
tools I have to work with. Theology
teaches us that the primal curse was a condemnation
to work. It was the primal blessing
instead. That's an aside. I have good
friends up in the mountains, chief among
whom is Judy Peters."
</p>

<p>
"The Queen of the mountains? I've heard
of her. She's an erratic political factor with
whom every candidate must reckon, I'm
told."
</p>

<p>
"She's all that. She controls the mountain
vote in her district as absolutely as the Superintendent
of the Penitentiary was to have controlled
me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear Boyd, I beg you to put
aside that sort of brooding. It's morbid, it's
hurtful to your character, it's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. But I'm not pardoned yet,
you know, and naturally&mdash;never mind. I
was speaking of Judy. She doesn't abuse her
political power. In many elections she doesn't
use it at all. She says to her subjects: 'I ain't
choosed 'twixt them two candidates. Choose
for yourselves.' But when she does choose
and intimates her choice the men of the mountain
all vote her way, and their vote makes an
end of all uncertainty as to the result of that
election. But it isn't only in politics that she
rules. A Baptist preacher went up that way
once and became pastor of a church. For a
while he 'cut a wide swath,' as Judy said.
But he made the mistake of offending her
majesty by some indiscreet criticism of her.
She manifested no displeasure, but on the
next Sunday and the next he found a meeting
house full of empty benches to preach to.
Then he quit, as Judy afterwards explained,
'because his usefulness was at its end.' It's
the same way with everything else. Ordinarily
she does not interfere, but when she does her
interference is instantly effective. It's a common
saying up there that 'ef you want to
stay in the mountings comfortable like, you
don't want to git yourself into Judy Peters's
bad books.'"
</p>

<p>
"On what does her extraordinary influence
rest?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be hard to say. Partly I should
say upon her extraordinary sagacity, especially
in her judgment of men and her penetration
of their motives. My father used to say she
had second sight of the Scottish sort. It is
certain that no man ever deceives her for long,
no false pretense ever endures her scrutiny,
and she never falters in her judgments. She
is as relentless as Fate itself and as merciless
in her dealings with what she adjudges to be
wrong. As she doesn't know what fear means,
she is equally resolute in her active support of
all causes that enlist her sympathy. She is
ignorant, as we reckon such things, but her
sagacity is well nigh supernatural, and she
keeps herself informed on all matters that interest
her, with an accuracy that a detective
bureau might envy. She is kindly, but not
courteous. She hates shams with an elemental
intensity. If you are a guest in her house she
fulfils every obligation of hospitality, but she
tells you no lies either in word or deed. She
will lay herself out to serve you with sublime
fried chicken and glorified waffles, but if she
catches you in a falsehood she'll tell you you
are a liar even while she presses the apple
butter or the maple syrup upon your acceptance.
In brief, Judy Peters is altogether a
natural human being, whose elemental passions
have never been curbed by convention,
whose courage is of the kind that never shrinks
from the recognition of truth or from its telling
in plain words. If she likes you she will say
so. If she dislikes you she will tell you the
fact in equally plain words. If she is in doubt
about you, she will tell you she 'ain't choosed
yit' as to you. That's Judy. Still my description
utterly lacks something, I don't know
what&mdash;personality perhaps. You must know
Judy personally if you would understand her.
Her malignity, in cases that seem to her to
call for it, is well nigh beyond conception in
its devilish ingenuity and persistence; her loyalty,
on the other hand, stops at nothing that
may serve its fortunate beneficiary. She was
my father's friend, in her odd way, and she is
mine. My father once rendered her a service;
I don't know what it was, and she won't tell
me. He always said it was a trifle of no consequence;
she always answers my inquiries about
it by saying:
</p>

<p>
"''Tain't none o' your business, Boyd, what
he done for me, but ef I could 'a' turned these
here mountings upside down an' he'd 'a' give
the word as how he wanted it done, over the
mountings would 'a' gone, you kin bet your
bottom dollar on that proposition.'
</p>

<p>
"She is my friend on my father's account
and nothing can change that. If I should try
to deceive her she'd denounce me to my face
as a liar, but she'd make the mountains too hot
to hold anybody else who should suggest such
a thing, and she'd go on doing her mightiest
in my interest, in spite of my fault. In her
way she is a wholesome sort of person for me
to meet just now, and I'm going to spend a
few days with her, just for the bracing up
she'll give me. After that I'll go on up into
the high mountains."
</p>

<p>
So ended the dinner and the conversation.
Next morning Westover set out for Wanalah,
where he intended to spend a few days giving
necessary directions and equipping himself with
supplies for his sojourn in the mountains.
These consisted of books, mainly, with a bag
of corn meal, a ham or two, a few sides of
bacon, guns, ammunition, fishing tackle and
rough clothing, all of which were loaded into
an ox cart, which a negro boy was to drive in
leisurely fashion to Judy Peters's. Beyond
that, in the climb up the mountainside, oxen
would be of less use than bother, and Westover
depended upon the long legs and strong
arms of mountaineers to manage the further
transportation.

XIII
<br />
"AUNT BETSY" TAKES THE HELM
</h3>

<p>
It would have been a dangerous thing for
any man to accuse Colonel Conway of
cowardice. Personal courage was his in
full measure. Three times during the Mexican
war he had been promoted&mdash;rising from
lieutenant to colonel&mdash;and each time in special
recognition of "conspicuous gallantry in
action." He was afraid of no man and no
company of men. He did and dared throughout
his life with absolute disregard of danger.
</p>

<p>
But Colonel Conway was mightily afraid of
his sister Betsy, as his daughter had said.
Why, he could not have told, but the fact remained
that he was afraid of that elderly little
woman, encased as she was in an armor of
conventionalities, gentle but resolute, and mercilessly
insistent upon what she decreed to be
"proper" conduct.
</p>

<p>
When the negro boy who daily brought the
letter bag from the post office to The Oaks
reported that Mr. Boyd Westover had come up
from Richmond and was to stay only for a
day or two at Wanalah, Colonel Conway
promptly announced his purpose to ride over
and congratulate him. The family were at
the breakfast table at the time and the Colonel
observed that his daughter paled at the mention
of his purpose, though she said nothing
in reply to his declaration. His sister, "Aunt
Betsy," also said nothing. It was her habit to
say nothing till the time was ripe.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after breakfast Margaret
sought speech with her father.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, father, and what you purpose
is the part of an honorable man. You
ought to go to Boyd and take his hand, and
make him feel that men of your kind and his
kind understand. But&mdash;" She paused uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
"'But' what, daughter?" asked the Colonel,
eagerly scanning her face.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing. I was only going to say that
perhaps it will be just as well not to mention
me&mdash;unless he does so first."
</p>

<p>
There was that in her hesitating utterance
which awakened the Colonel's attention and
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"But why not, Margaret?" he questioned.
"Surely it is about you he will be most eager
to hear."
</p>

<p>
"If so he will ask. If he doesn't, I beg of
you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, surely you've heard from him frequently
during this trouble&mdash;and you've written
to him?"
</p>

<p>
"I've written to him, yes."
</p>

<p>
"And he has written to you, of course?"
</p>

<p>
The girl stood silent, while she plucked
honeysuckles from the vines that shrouded the
porch in which they stood, and nervously
pulled them to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Answer me, child," the Colonel said in a
tone of command. "Hasn't Boyd Westover
written to you during all this trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"I have received no letter from him," she
answered hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that he hasn't written to you
of his arrest, trial and all the rest of it, of his
vindication and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have had no letter from him," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't he even offered you a release from
your engagement?"
</p>

<p>
"I have had no letter from him," she said
again, but this time she lost her self control
and blurted out the thought that had troubled
her for many days.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Father," she said, seizing his arm as
if to detain him, "there has been some cruel
mistake, some miscarriage, something, I don't
know what. I only know that Boyd Westover
is a gentleman and would never have neglected
such a duty."
</p>

<p>
"As he <i>has</i> neglected it, he is unworthy
of a gentleman's recognition, Margaret. I
shall not go near him."
</p>

<p>
"You are judging him unheard," she
promptly and passionately answered; "and oh,
Father, that isn't like you, because it is unworthy,
and nothing unworthy or unjust is
like you. I beg of you, give him a chance.
You need do nothing but make a call. The
explanation will follow&mdash;if there is an explanation.
If there isn't&mdash;well, we shall
know."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go, daughter, of course. It is my duty.
But I'll force the explanation. I have a right
to ask him why, being engaged to marry my
daughter, he has sent her no release, in view of
the circumstances. That will bring out all
there is to say on the subject."
</p>

<p>
At that point in their conversation the father
and daughter were interrupted by the advent
of "Aunt Betsy," who passed from the house
into the porch quite casually, and said to Margaret:
</p>

<p>
"When you have leisure, dear, you'd better
see Janet. She has come to say that Diana is
much worse this morning and that the doctor,
who was in a hurry, left some important written
directions out at the quarters."
</p>

<p>
Quick to respond to duty, especially where
the sick of the plantation were concerned, Margaret
was in the saddle a minute later and galloping
toward the "quarters," as the negro
village was called in plantation nomenclature.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had her sorrel palfry's white tail
flashed its signal of departure through the
outer grove, than "Aunt Betsy" turned to her
brother, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Of course you forgot yourself, brother,
when you impulsively declared your purpose
to visit Mr. Boyd Westover to-day. The one
serious fault in your nature is impulsiveness.
You are too chivalric, too trusting, too confident
of others, too apt to think of them as men
like yourself."
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want to say, Betsy?" asked
the Colonel as he sank limply into one of the
porch chairs.
</p>

<p>
"Only that upon reflection you must see
that it won't do for you to call upon Mr.
Westover."
</p>

<p>
"But why not?"
</p>

<p>
"There are a dozen reasons. He's a man
under a cloud you know. He has been regularly
convicted of a crime, and sentenced for
it, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But he has been fully vindicated and pardoned,"
interrupted the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course. Fully vindicated by the
confession of a demented man who may or
may not know what he is saying. It may be&mdash;well,
anything may be, you know, and opinions
in this community are likely to be divided
as to the matter of Mr. Boyd Westover's guilt.
So long as that remains unsettled the Master
of The Oaks cannot afford to take sides by
visiting Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that I, Colonel Robert Conway,
of The Oaks, am not free to do as I damn
please just because a lot of pestilent old gossips
think to say me nay?"
</p>

<p>
"You misunderstand me, Robert, and you
grieve me to the heart by the violence of your
language."
</p>

<p>
"Did I swear? If so I beg pardon, but
sometimes oaths will slip out. It's a bad habit
I acquired in the army."
</p>

<p>
"You utterly fail to understand me," said
"Aunt Betsy." "I am not concerned about
myself or you, or the family name, though that
is dearer to me than all else in the world. I'm
concerned for Margaret. You are a man, of
course, but even a man ought to see that for
Margaret's father to visit Westover of Wanalah,
under existing circumstances, would be
everywhere interpreted as throwing Margaret
at his head, challenging him to fulfil his engagement
with her. In brief it would be almost
the equivalent of that vulgar impossibility
in Virginia, a breach of promise suit."
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betsy" saw in Colonel Conway's
face that she had carried her point, and she
did not imperil the result by further speech.
She suddenly applied her handkerchief to her
eyes instead, and hastily retreated to her room,
confident that on that day at least her brother
would not ride over to Wanalah.

<br />
WESTOVER AT WANALAH
</h3>

<p>
But if Colonel Conway did not visit
Westover during his brief stay at Wanalah,
some others did. In the main
they were elderly men of his own social class,
whose purpose was sincere to express their
pleasure in his escape from an embarrassing
perplexity. But their very sincerity proved to
be the undoing of their purpose. They hardly
knew how to approach the subject of his
trouble without offence and yet it seemed necessary
to speak of it. It isn't easy to tell a
man of high place in the world that you are
pleased with his accidental escape from a term
of penal servitude in the penitentiary. As a
result of this embarrassment the congratulations
of these gentlemen, which were meant to
be cordial, seemed to Westover to be coldly
commiserative instead. Meant to be comradely,
they seemed to him condescending
almost to the point of offensiveness. To make
matters worse, Westover's visitors were as
sorely embarrassed as he was, and by way
of escape, every one of them, upon one pretext
or another, declined his invitation to
stay to dinner which, under ordinary circumstances,
every one of them would have accepted
quite as a matter of course. To him
this suggested avoidance of intimacy.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps all this was emphasized to his mind
by his experience with the earliest of his visitors
on that day. This was William Wilberforce
Webb, a young lawyer who as representative
of the county in the House of Delegates&mdash;the
legislature of Virginia&mdash;regarded
himself as "a rising young statesman, in the
direct line of promotion."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Webb was not a man in Westover's
class, and in visiting Wanalah at all he was
guilty of something approaching presumption,
under the rules of the social régime of that
time and country. Still, as the representative
of the county in the legislature, he had a right
perhaps to regard himself as privileged to that
extent.
</p>

<p>
However that might be, Westover welcomed
him cordially as the first of his neighbors to
call. He extended the customary hospitalities
of the house, which the other accepted. Then
the two fell into conversation upon general
topics, drifting into more personal themes by
natural processes. Lacking the tact that comes
of good breeding, the voluble and self appreciative
lawyer presently sought to exalt his own
condescension in promptly calling upon Westover.
</p>

<p>
"You see I have no hidebound prejudices,
Westover, and in my position, as the representative
of the people, the promptitude of my visit
may encourage others to recognize you, in
spite of what has happened."
</p>

<p>
Pale to the lips with passion, Westover rose
as the man spoke, moved to the edge of the
porch in which they had been sitting, and, calling
to a negro boy, said:
</p>

<p>
"Bring this gentleman's horse to the door at
once; do you hear? He has imperative business
elsewhere than at Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the meaning of this,
and Webb was quick to comprehend it. Rising
angrily he asked:
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"You heard my instruction to the boy," answered
Westover in an even, unexcited voice.
"You can infer my meaning from that. By
the way, the boy has obeyed promptly and your
horse is waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
The man was unaccustomed to such deliberation
and self control in the speech of an angry
person, but he sought to imitate it as he had
sought before to copy the manners of those
whose social position he envied. He suppressed
the impulse of intemperate speech
and, assuming the dignity that he thought
belonged to him in right of his "position,"
said:
</p>

<p>
"You will hear from me, promptly, Mr.
Westover."
</p>

<p>
"At your pleasure, sir," answered Westover.
"I shall remain at Wanalah for four
days, after to-day. After that I shall be absent
for a time, but should your message to me be
delayed so long, which I can hardly conceive
to be possible, you can communicate with me
later through my overseer, with whom I shall
leave an address to be used only in emergencies.
Should you leave any message with him he
will have instructions to forward it to me by
a special courier who will lose no time in its
delivery."
</p>

<p>
This was a crowning affront to a man of
Webb's extraction, and perhaps Westover
meant it to be such. The overseer class in
Virginia was the most inferior of all, and the
very suggestion of one gentleman that he
would communicate with another through his
overseer would have implied insult. If Westover
had been speaking to one whom he regarded
as an equal he would have said:
</p>

<p>
"My address for a time will be uncertain,
but my overseer will have it and I'll instruct
him to keep my lawyer informed of it from
time to time."
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, it was the bitterest
drop of gall in Webb's cup that he was himself
descended from a race of overseers. His
father, indeed, had never served in that capacity,
for the reason that the grandfather had left
him enough money to buy a little plantation
of his own and struggle for recognition as a
member of the planter class. But Webb had
learned by experience that there was vitality
in the Virginian dogma that "it takes three
generations to make a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion, therefore, that he might,
if necessary, communicate with Westover
through the Wanalah overseer, was peculiarly
offensive to Webb. Whether Westover had
intended it to be so or not, there is no means
of finding out. He was angry enough to intend
anything.
</p>

<p>
But this encounter spoiled Westover's capacity
to enjoy the visits of his later coming
friends. It set his sensitiveness on edge, as
it were, and prompted his mind to misinterpretation,
so that when he was left to dine
alone at Wanalah that day the very spaciousness
of the dining room seemed to mock his
solitude, while the polished furniture that had
witnessed so much of joyous festivity in that
great banquet hall seemed to have put on
mourning for its master.
</p>

<p>
About sunset, however, relief came to Westover's
spirit in the person of Dr. Carley Farnsworth.
His real name was Don Carlos Farnsworth,
and he was a physician, but to Westover
as to every other friend he had ever had,
he was known as "Carley." Carley was in
many ways peculiar. He was cynical at times
and always disposed to take a whimsical view
of things. His sense of humor was alert and
keen, though he never in his life made a joke
and very rarely laughed. His most whimsical
interpretations of events and situations were
delivered in solemn, philosophical fervor, and
with a seriousness that well nigh undid the
humor of them.
</p>

<p>
He arrived at Wanalah about sunset, and
greeted his old friend cordially, and quite as
if his visit had been an ordinary one with no
"circumstances" of any kind behind it. Carley
Farnsworth was a gentleman, that was all.
He had tact and <i>nous</i>, and above all a sympathy
so abounding that trespass upon another's
sensibilities was impossible to him. Even in
examining patients, it was said of him that he
asked all his questions in a way that made
them seem a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
After the first greetings were over he said:
</p>

<p>
"I've been rather impatiently waiting for
your return to Wanalah, Boyd, because I've
been wanting to floor you with half a dozen
authorities that agree with me as to the construction
of <i>ut</i> with the subjunctive in that
passage we came so near fighting about. I've
devoted all my time lately to the task of accumulating
ammunition and after supper I'm
going to blow you clear out of the arena. But
supper first, of course. I'm a hungry hygienist
and I know the flavor of the Wanalah hams.
By the way, you and I are alone; why
shouldn't we be dissolute? If you'll tell your
cook to serve us some roasted black-eyed peas,
such as you and I ate here a year ago,&mdash;roasted
in the pod you know, and served with
the hot ashes on them,&mdash;I'll promise to be
happy for a whole year to come. Of course
there'll be broiled tomatoes as an adjunct to
the cold ham, and paper thin wafer biscuit to
keep our digestions in order, and after supper
we'll discuss '<i>ut</i> with the subjunctive' as far
into the night as you please."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Westover, smiling for
the first time that day. "I'm ready for the
contest, though really I don't think either of
us is Latin scholar enough to be entitled to
'views' on the subject."
</p>

<p>
"There you annoyingly agree with the authorities,"
answered Dr. Farnsworth. "You
see I wrote to Professor Anthon on the subject,
submitting my contentions, and he replied
most courteously, suggesting that if I
would supplement my obviously rudimentary
Latin studies with a more considerable reading
of Latin texts,&mdash;he mentioned fifteen
hundred or so that he thought I might profitably
run through in my leisure moments,&mdash;I
would gain some slight insight into the
grammatical problem I had undertaken to
settle out of my own inner consciousness and
Bullion's Latin Grammar. The thing put me
on my mettle, so I wrote to our own University
professor, Dr. Gessner Harrison. What
do you think? He replied: 'My dear Dr.
Farnsworth: You're a sublimated idiot and
a good many different kinds of a donkey.'
Those weren't his exact words, you understand,
but the paraphrase fairly interprets the
spirit of his reply. However, we'll leave all
that till after supper."
</p>

<p>
So he chattered on, after his habit, and he
succeeded not only in preventing talk of depressing
things, but in amusing his host so far
as to awaken something like jollity in him.
</p>

<p>
But an occurrence during supper threatened
to spoil all. A missive arrived from Webb,
borne not by a friend commissioned to "act
for him," but by a negro servant.
</p>

<p>
Westover tore the envelope open and read
the few lines written upon the sheet within.
They ran as follows:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Webb intimated to Mr. Westover today
that he would presently send him a hostile
note. Upon reflection Mr. Webb has decided
that he cannot afford to send anything of the
kind. It seems to him and to such friends as
he has had time to consult that recent events
affecting Mr. Westover's status in society&mdash;events
which need not be specified in detail&mdash;have
rendered it unnecessary and unbecoming
for any gentleman to pay attention to anything
that Mr. Westover may say or do."
</p>

<p>
Having read the insolent message with no
sign of anger that would have been observed
by anybody, Westover turned to his dining-room
servant and said, quite indifferently:
</p>

<p>
"Send the boy who brought that note to me.
I wish to speak to him."
</p>

<p>
When the negro messenger entered, Westover
asked:
</p>

<p>
"Do you belong to Mr. Webb?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir. Laws a Massy, Mas' Boyd, he
don't own no folks er nothin' else. He jes'
hires me to fetch and carry for him sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so. How much did he pay you
to bring this note to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Eighteen pence, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now I want you to carry it back to
him and I'll give you two and threepence for
the service. I'll make it half a dollar, if you'll
tell him just what I say."
</p>

<p>
In old Virginia "eighteen pence" meant a
quarter of a dollar, and "two and threepence"
meant thirty-seven and a half cents, the shilling
then being sixteen and two-thirds cents,
as the result of some ancient debasement of
coin in England.
</p>

<p>
"Suttenly, sir. Ef what you wants me to
say is so superfluous like as to make him mad,
I reckon I kin run faster'n he kin."
</p>

<p>
"Very well then. I want you to hand him
back his letter and say:
</p>

<p>
"'Mas' Boyd Westover says he hasn't time
just now to ride seven miles to the Court House
to pull your nose or slap your jaws, but he'll
attend to the matter at the first convenient opportunity.'
Can you say that?"
</p>

<p>
"No," interrupted Carley Farnsworth.
"Why should you want him to? It wouldn't
add a cubit to the stature of your dignity and
it wouldn't be any worse affront to Webb than
you can put upon him by sending his note back
without a word. He would rejoice in a quarrel
with you&mdash;a safe one at arm's length I
mean. It would exalt him in the eyes of
others, and as he's a member of the legislature
sure of his reelection, you can't challenge him
or he you. You may hold any view you please
as to '<i>ut</i>' with the subjunctive, but on this
matter you simply mustn't obey the impulses of
temporary anger. Send the letter back without
a word, and to-morrow you'll thank me
for bringing philosophy and common sense to
the restraint of an impulse that has its root in
the dormant but still potential savagery of your
nature."
</p>

<p>
Westover laughed at the solemn ponderousness
of his friend's utterance, and the laughter
was good for him.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, of course," he said. "Here,
Sam, just take this letter back to Mr. Webb
and tell him I sent no message of any kind.
And here's your half dollar."
</p>

<p>
Then, as the negro left the room the young
man said:
</p>

<p>
"After all, my time hasn't come yet, and
meanwhile I must preserve my dignity. You
see, Carley, I am still Westover of Wanalah,
and I mean to prove it to all men by doing
things. I don't know yet what things they
are to be, but they must be worthy of the name
I bear. I'm going off to rest and think for
a while, and when I come back to Wanalah
Jack Towns will tell me what tools I have to
work with. Meanwhile brawling with an underbred
fellow like Webb would be most unbecoming."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to see that you have lucid intervals,
Boyd," answered his friend. "I reckon
we won't bother with Latin Grammar to-night.
Let's play backgammon instead. But in the
meantime let me give you a professional opinion
and some professional advice. You are
neurasthenic and you've got to get over it.
Your mountain trip will be good for you, but
it would be better still if you could get up a
fight of some sort. I'll try to stir up something
of the kind for you, when you get back. Anyhow,
you've got to <i>quit thinking about yourself</i>.
Let me assure you that there are thousands
of more interesting topics to think
about. There's lettuce, for example, and
there is music, to say nothing of onions and
roe herrings and the Missouri Compromise,
and the relations of agriculture to national
wealth, and 'possum hunting, and black-eyed
peas and the Dred Scott decision and the
morality of flipping quarters at crack loo.
Oh, here's the backgammon board. Let's get
to work."

<br />
UP AT JUDY'S
</h3>

<p>
Robust as he was, Boyd Westover felt
himself somewhat weary and footsore
when he put one hand on the top rail
of Judy Peters's gateless fence and sprang
over it to greet his hostess.
</p>

<p>
She was waiting for him of course. She had
caught sight of him far down the mountain,
at one of the many turns of the road which
were conveniently visible from her door or her
other points of observation. It was not Judy's
habit to be surprised by any arrival. She had
had no warning of Westover's intended visit,
but she was keen of vision, and had had no
difficulty in recognizing the wayfarer four
miles away, if measured by the tortuosities of
the road, and perhaps a mile away as the crow
flies.
</p>

<p>
That had been two or three hours before the
time of his actual arrival, but Judy had not
wondered at the delay. She knew Boyd's ways
and she had made out that he had fishing tackle
with him.
</p>

<p>
"Sapphiry," she had asked her daughter,
"how many chickens has you got picked an'
fixed in the spring house."
</p>

<p>
"Four," answered Sapphira. "Why,
Mammy?"
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind why." Then relenting
toward the girl's curiosity she said:
</p>

<p>
"Boyd Westover's a comin', an' he'll be
mighty hungry fer supper. He's afoot an'
it's more'n twenty mile from his place here.
Besides that he's got four big branches to fish
afore he gits here an' that'll take a heap o'
walkin' to say nothin' o' the len'th o' the road.
So you jes' go on with your ironin' till I tell
you to set about gittin' supper."
</p>

<p>
"May be he won't fish the branches," suggested
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, an' may be the moon'll rise in the
west to-night an' run wrong way 'crost the
firmament. It's the same sort of a may be,
an' that sort never happens."
</p>

<p>
"What you reckon he's a comin' fer,
Mammy?" asked Sapphira as she held up a
stiffly starched garment to inspect her work.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, an' it don't make no difference
neither, as the feller says. Boyd Westover's
father always found a welcome a waitin' at the
fence when he come to Judy Peters's house,
an' I's got the same sort o' welcome a holdin'
out both han's for Boyd when he comes."
Then by way of a more direct though conjectural
answer to her daughter's question she
added:
</p>

<p>
"Reckon he wants to git away from them
stuckups down his way. I hear they's a been
a botherin' of him o' late. Coffey, William,
son to Jesse, was a tellin' me all about
it."
</p>

<p>
The form "Coffey, William, son to Jesse,"
was one in familiar use in the mountains as a
means of identifying one among a multitude
of men bearing the same name. There were
several families whose membership was so all
pervasive of that region that some such method
of identification on the polling lists and elsewhere
was a necessity, and the polling list
nomenclature had been very generally adopted
into ordinary use.
</p>

<p>
"What was 't all 'bout, Mammy?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno, only, whatever 'twas, another
feller done it."
</p>

<p>
With that lucid explanation Judy set her
flatiron on a trivet in front of the fire and
went to one of her points of vantage to scan
the road below. On her return she took Sapphira's
flatiron from her hand, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I'll finish up the ironin'. They ain't but
three or four pieces. You run over to the furdest
'tater patch an' gravel a pan o' potaters.
Git a plenty of 'em, kase they's mighty good
with fish."
</p>

<p>
To "gravel" potatoes is to dig into the
"hill" in which the vines grow, from its side
remove the larger potatoes from the rootlets,
close up the opening and leave the vines to
bring the remaining tubers to perfection. It
is a process that yields new potatoes before
their time and without destroying the growths.
The potatoes secured in that way are very
small, very unwholesome, but altogether delicious.
</p>

<p>
"May be he didn't git no fish," said Sapphira
doubtingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you jes' look after the potater maybes.
That's your job. The fish'll git here all
right kase I seen him a cleanin' of 'em on the
rocks down 'long Samson's branch. He won't
fish no more this evenin' an' he'll be here in
less 'n an hour. So mosey along an' git them
potaters. Soon's I git through with this petticoat,
I'll sif' some meal fer batter bread, git
out a crock o' apple butter, an' cut up some
tomatuses. Boyd Westover's hungry an' he's
a goin' to have a good supper ef Judy Peters
knows her business, an' she thinks she do."
</p>

<p>
When Boyd nimbly swung himself over the
fence, all preliminary preparations for the evening
meal were completely made, and Judy
stood ready to welcome him. In his honor
she had changed the limp, hot weather gown
that had served her during her ironing, for
a stiffly starched calico in the violently high
colors of which her barbaric soul mightily
rejoiced.
</p>

<p>
For greeting Judy said:
</p>

<p>
"You's come up to shake off the stuck-ups,
Boyd, an' git among natural folks I s'pose.
Anyhow you're welcome. Them's beauties,"
looking into Boyd's fish basket, "an' they's a
flat-back an' two catfish among 'em. I'd
ruther eat a catfish or a flat-back any time
than a trout. Trout's sort o' stuck up fish,
even ef they does live up here in the mountings.
But I ain't forgot how to make trout good
with the sauce your pappy learnt me how to
make&mdash;sauce All on Days he called it,&mdash;an'
I'll make you some fer supper."
</p>

<p>
Presumably Judy meant sauce Hollandaise.
At any rate the sauce she served with the trout
that night was a glorified example of the dressing
that <i>chefs</i> call by that name, improved by
the gastronomic genius of the late Westover
of Wanalah, and made by Judy Peters, whose
instinct was infallible in the manufacture of
things delectable to the palate.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Judy observed something in Boyd
Westover's face,&mdash;a look of utter weariness
that she was sagacious enough to interpret
aright, though she made no mention of her
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
"He's got things on his mind," she reflected;
"an' they's more tiresome like than
all the trampin' a feller can do. His legs is
good fer twice the walkin' he's done to-day.
Never mind. We'll fix that up afore we're
through."
</p>

<p>
Then turning to Westover she said:
</p>

<p>
"You is awful tired, Boyd, even ef you did
clear the fence like a yearlin' colt. Now you's
a goin' to rest. Never min' tellin' me nothin'
'bout what you're here for nor none o' the rest
of it. You's a-goin' to have a nap. It'll be
a hour or may be two hour afore supper's
ready, 'cause I's got that sauce All on Days to
make, an' it's a slow job. It's awful hot this
evenin'"&mdash;Judy meant afternoon, but like the
more aristocratic Virginians she called everything
between noon and nightfall "evening"
and everything after dusk "night," as in very
fact it was.
</p>

<p>
"It's awful hot this evenin', but they's a
good breeze a blowin' through the passage, an'
they's a broad sofy there, three foot wide an'
seven foot long, an' there you's a goin' to
spen' the time twix this an' supper. They's
pillers a plenty, an' you ain't got nothin' to do
only to lay down an' git a good rest. Come
on in."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Boyd Westover was comfortably
asleep, with the assurance that there
were no shams or false pretenses in the hospitality
he was enjoying, and it was more than
two hours later before Judy permitted him to
be waked. She was accustomed to dominate
everything in her own household, suppers included,
and this particular supper she had
"sot back" by a full hour in order that her
guest might have his nap out. Even then she
forbade a rude awakening. She simply parsed
two or three times through the broad passageway
between the two log houses that constituted
her home, until the swish of her starched
calico skirts awakened him "drop by drop
like," as she explained to Sapphira and those
of her long-legged sons who had "turned up"
for supper in the maternal home. Those boys,
Webster, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson and
Theonidas&mdash;heaven only knows where Judy
got that name&mdash;were always uncertain quantities
in the household. Each was a law unto
himself. They came and went at their own
free will, giving no account of themselves.
Home was home to them. They appeared
there, sure of a welcome, whenever it suited
their convenience to do so. Sometimes all four
would be there; sometimes not one of them
would appear for months at a time. In either
case no questions were asked and no accounts
given. The boys were strong of limb, alert,
industrious, independent. They made their
own living by doing any sort of work that fell
in their way, and they envied no man his lot
or his possessions. They were types of a robust
citizenship of which the Trusts and the
Trades Unions&mdash;conspiracies both in restraint
alike of trade and of liberty&mdash;have left us
small trace in this modern world.

Their ages varied from thirteen to nineteen

JUDY PETERS'S DIAGNOSIS
</h3>

<p>
"Now come out here, Boyd," said
Judy when the supper was over.
"They's a full moon or purty nigh
onto it, an' it's a raisin', an' the weather's good
an' hot,&mdash;good fer growin' corn, an' not bad
fer apples an' pertaters. You an' me is a goin'
to have a good long talk. Take that there
rockin' chair an' make yourself comfortable,
like, 'cause I want to hear all about it."

<span class="smcap">Now come out here, Boyd.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 161.</i>
</p>

<p>
The rocking chairs sat upon a broad porch
or platform, for it had no roof over it, and the
rising moon flooded the place with light.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me all about it," said Judy when
the two were seated.
</p>

<p>
It is to be said that Judy knew "all about
it" already, at least all about what had happened
up to a very few days before. It was
her habit to keep herself fully informed on all
subjects that interested her, and she was
mightily interested in everything that concerned
any Westover.
</p>

<p>
Her loyalty to the Westovers had its own
reasons for being. These she never explained.
She rarely explained anything personal to herself.
But that loyalty was barbaric in its intensity
of devotion, savage in its vindictiveness
toward whatever and whomsoever antagonized
the Westovers, and recklessly relentless in its
manifestations.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Boyd Westover fell into difficulties
in Richmond, she sent one of her henchmen
there with instructions to employ a lawyer to
keep her informed. When Boyd returned to
Wanalah she sent Edgar Coffey to the county
seat to report happenings and conditions. She
said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Edgar, I has choosed you fer this job, bekase
o' several pints in your character. You
is slick an' sly, an' you ain't got no principles
to stand in your way, an' you seems to be
stupid, so's nobody'll suspect you or keep silent
when you's about. You kin lie so natural
like that nobody but me'd ever suspect you was
a lyin' at all. What you's got to do is to go
down there to the Court House on some sort
o' made up business like, an' hang 'round an'
listen, an' find out how the stuck-ups is
a treatin' Boyd Westover. Then you come
back here an' tell me 'bout it. Ef them stuckups
treats him fa'r an' squa'r like, it'll be all
right. Ef they don't, I'll make some of 'em
wisht they hadn't never 'a' been borned." This
last utterance was addressed only to herself.
</p>

<p>
Edgar Coffey had returned on the evening
before Westover's arrival and his report had
included some account of Webb's boasting that
he had "declined to consider Boyd Westover
as a man entitled to the attention of a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Now wait, Edgar," Judy said, when Coffey
reported this; "don't let your loose tongue
git away with you. Did you hear him say
that hisself&mdash;the durned little two-cent postage?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Judy, sure an' certain; an' everybody
down that way's a laughin' in their sleeves
'bout it. They says, says they, 'Why, ef Boyd
Westover was to git a real mad on him, that
feller wouldn't make a mouthful fer him.'"
</p>

<p>
"No more would he," said Judy, addressing
herself.
</p>

<p>
So Judy knew in advance the whole story
that she asked Westover to tell her; but she
wanted to hear his version of it and find out
his mood of mind concerning it, and so she
gave no sign of knowing anything. That was
Judy's way.
</p>

<p>
Just as the two comfortably seated themselves
Theonidas&mdash;the thirteen year old son
of the house&mdash;emerged from within bearing
a tray on which were a stone jug, a vase-like
glass, containing honey in the comb, two tumblers
and a little array of spoons.
</p>

<p>
"Now wait a minute, Boyd," said Judy as
she directed the placing of the tray on a table
that stood between her and Westover. "You's
got a lot o' durned temperance nonsense mixed
up with your good sense, but this is a 'ceptional
occasion; I ain't yit had a chanst to
drink to the new 'Westover of Wanalah,' nor
yit to congratulate you; an' besides that, they
ain't no harm in a glass o' peach an' honey
when I raised the honey an' made the peach
myself, an' specially when the peach is thirteen
year ole in the bar'l. So you an' me is a goin'
to have a glass o' peach an' honey together,
sich as folks don't often taste these days.
They was three bar'ls o' that there peach
brandy, when my husband, Marcellus, an' me
made it, thirteen year ago, an' that jug's got
the last drop that's left of it. An' the best of
it is they ain't never anybody but the best been
let to let it trickle down their throats. When
it were five year old I sold one bar'l of it to
Tom Griffin in Richmond, 'cause he never
would let anybody but the best have any of
it. When it were ten year old I give one bar'l
of it to your pappy, 'cause I jes' know'd what
sort o' folks he'd let drink it. You see the
peaches that year&mdash;thirteen year ago&mdash;was
extra superfine, an' I picked out the very best
of 'em for them three bar'ls o' brandy, an' they
ain't been no peach like it ever made in these
here mountings. So now you an' me's a goin'
to have a glass o' peach an' honey, an' sip it
slow like, while we talk, so's that we kin git
the taste in our throats an' all the way down.
You see, Boyd, they's tricks in makin' peach
jes' as they is in politics an' religion an' school
teachin' and gittin' married. They wa'n't no
trick when I got married, mind. I don't mean
that. Marcellus Peters was as good a man as
these here mountings ever raised, an' now he's
been dead more'n a dozen years I ain't got no
complaint to make 'bout him. Only he hadn't
much 'git there' in him. It didn't make much
difference, 'cause I could ten' to that part o'
the business myself. But he did know how to
make peach an' apple brandy. You see, Boyd,
they's tricks in makin' peach, as I was a sayin',
an' Marcellus he know'd all of 'em. I ain't
a sayin' he didn't work 'em off on folks as
didn't know nor care. He'd git a order fer
peach when he hadn't no peach, an' he'd fill
the order. He'd take ten pound or so o' dried
peaches an' set 'em to stew fer an hour or
so. Then he'd put 'em through the bung hole
of a bar'l o' apple brandy, an' let 'em 'sociate
with the brandy like, fer three or four days,
rollin' the bar'l now an' then to shake it up,
like. Then he'd draw that brandy off into another
bar'l, an' it was fine old peach. Same
with cherry brandy, or blackberry, an' the
stuck-ups didn't know the difference. But this
here peach is differenter. It was made of
peaches, good peaches, such as you'd smile to
eat, an' Tom Griffin was glad to pay me seven
dollars a gallon for the bar'l of it he got. I
reckon he'd pay twice that ef he could git another
bar'l of it now."
</p>

<p>
Judy Peters was not talking without a definite
purpose. She never did that. Even when
her conversation rambled as it did on this
occasion, it rambled of set purpose and with
deliberate intent. This time her purpose was
to induce a like rambling impulse on Boyd
Westover's part, so that she might not only
hear from his lips the whole story of his tribulations,
but gather, by the wayside of his conversation
as it were, a clear impression of his
present mood and attitude of mind, something
which could not be gained by direct questioning.
</p>

<p>
In all this the shrewdly wise old woman
succeeded, and when Boyd Westover bade her
good night as the clock struck twelve, she knew
all she wanted to know about him. After he
had gone to bed she lighted her pipe anew and
summed up her conclusions in the case of the
young man beneath her roof in reflections to
the following effect:
</p>

<p>
"He's a feelin' it more'n's good fer him.
</p>

<p>
"He's wrong in his mind or his liver or his
lights, an' the fust needfulness is to set 'em
right.
</p>

<p>
"He's a doin' the right thing in a goin'
off up into the high mountings. It'll straighten
out the liver an' lights an' I'll make Theonidas
go with him, jes' to take the rough off, an' to
keep him in company like. That'll be healthier
fer him.
</p>

<p>
"They's somethin' about a gal in the case,
but jes' naturally I couldn't git at that. Men
is sech fools 'bout women anyhow! A young
feller will pick one purty gal out'n a dozen,
all on 'em jes' as purty an' jes' as smart as she
is, an' ef she gives him the mitten he'll go
mournin' about, jes' as ef she was the onliest
tadpole in the puddle, while all the rest o' the
dozen purty gals is a standin' ready to make
as big a fool out'n him as ever she could 'a'
done. It's cur'ous but 'tain't to be helped no
way, I reckon.
</p>

<p>
"Howsomever the thing to do is to git him
interested in somethin', an' I kin manage that.
He'll git healthy like, up thar' in the high
mountings, an' by the time he comes back I'll
git somethin' ready fer him to do."
</p>

<p>
Boyd was already better in spirits when he
greeted the sun the next morning from the
top of a hill near Judy's place. The air of
the mountains had been good for him. Better
still had been Judy's cordiality and her naturalness.
After all his depression had been rooted
in the artificialities of human association, and
in Judy Peters's company there was no such
artificiality. She had not hesitated to interrupt
his narrative of events at various points
to tell him that in this or that particular he had
been a "darned fool," or a "frosted potater
vine," or a "dod dasted idjit," or something
else of the sort that she thought helpful to her
endeavor to bring him back to a healthy mental
condition.
</p>

<p>
Her main reliance for his restoration to
normality, however, was in getting something
strenuous for him to do. "Hard work's the
calomel he needs, an' a good hard fight's his
quinine. It'll cure his chills, an' I'll git it ready
fer him."
</p>

<p>
With that determination fixed in her mind,
Judy knocked the ashes out of her pipe, covered
up the kitchen fire, set some roe herrings to
soak, and went to bed. Sleep was to her
healthy soul a matter of course.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

XVII
<br />
JUDY INFORMS HERSELF AND MAKES PLANS
</h3>

<p>
It was well past midsummer when Westover
after a stay of three days went
from Judy Peters's place up into the
higher and more desolate parts of the mountain
region. He was accompanied by Theonidas,
whose instructions from his mother were
minute and explicit.
</p>

<p>
"B'ar in mind, Theonidas," she said to him
in an intimate conversation, "as how your
duty's to keep him busy with things outsiden'
hisself. He's got too many books 'long with
him, but they's good ef he don't git to readin'
of 'em by daylight. You's got to look out fer
that. Ef you find him a readin' an' a broodin'
by daylight, you jes' find out somethin' 'bout
a b'ar or a catamount hangin' round, an' git
him to lookin' fer that. An' ef he gits to
readin' too late o' nights, showin' as how his
min's oneasy like, you kin git up a night hunt
or somethin' like that, or ef that don't work
you kin go out an' yell like a painter till he gits
his gun."
</p>

<p>
A "painter," in mountain parlance, meant
a panther, or more properly the mountain lion,
a catlike, predatory beast between whom and
the mountaineers there was eternal war.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, Theonidas," concluded Judy,
"you ain't no fool, an' now as you knows my
intentions, you's to carry 'em out. Keep him
a goin'. Keep him busy. Keep him so durned
tired that he can't help sleepin' o' nights.
That's your cawntract. Ef he gits contrary an'
won't git sleepy an' you can't think o' nothin'
else to do, jes' you set down an' tell him a lot
o' your yarns. He's too perlite not to let you
talk on, an' I ain't never knowed nothin' as
would put a feller to sleep quicker'n one o' your
yarns, Theonidas."
</p>

<p>
In the event there proved to be no need of
the soporific influence of Theonidas's yarns.
Westover had gone into the mountains to distract
his mind with sport, and he pursued that
purpose ceaselessly by day and by night. He
would hunt deer, bears, turkeys, squirrels,
pheasants and every other species of game as
it came into the advancing season, throughout
the day, and at night after a campfire dinner
which he cooked for himself, he and Theonidas
would go eagerly in quest of night prowlers&mdash;'coons,
'possums, and painters. Now and then
he would send Theonidas down the mountain
with a present of game for Judy, while he
himself exercised his wits in controversy with
a certain wily old trout that was accustomed
to jeer at him from one or another pool of
the stream that flowed by the cabin door.
Sometimes he sent a haunch of venison, a half
dozen pheasants or a brace of young wild turkey
gobblers, with a request that Judy should
arrange for their delivery to Carley Farnsworth,
a commission he knew she would execute
to the letter.
</p>

<p>
In brief, young Westover was growing
healthy of mind and body again, while the
books he had brought with him to serve as
a means of killing time lay unopened in the
log cabin where he slept for long hours at such
times as physical weariness forbade him further
to follow the sports of the glorious out of
doors.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile Judy Peters was maturing
her plans. She kept Edgar Coffey most of the
time in the plantation part of the county, with
instructions to find out how the people down
there felt toward Westover, and who among
them might be trusted to aid her in a project
she had formed, when the time should be ripe
for its execution. As a result of Edgar's
mousing inquiries and her own shrewd skill in
discriminating between truth and falsehood in
his periodical reports, Judy Peters knew more
about sentiment in the piedmont region than
anybody there did, not excepting William Wilberforce
Webb, whose personal concern it was
to inform himself accurately as to that. She
knew, as Webb did not, that the great majority
of the men of Westover's own class&mdash;the men
of assured social position&mdash;were strongly disposed
to regard his misfortune with generous
sympathy, while those of less well assured
standing were disposed to shrug shoulders and
give hints of doubt.
</p>

<p>
She learned one thing, however, that
troubled her a good deal. Among those of
Westover's own class there was a vague, undefined
but none the less hurtful suspicion that
he had somehow failed of manly chivalry in his
treatment of Margaret Conway. The suspicion
had its origin in the fact that Colonel Conway
would in no way discuss Westover's case or
express any opinion concerning him or his conduct.
On the other hand it lacked definiteness
for the same reason. If there were no truth
in it, people argued, Colonel Conway would
certainly plant a heavy heel upon the rumor
as an act of simple justice to a falsely accused
young man; if there were truth in it, it was
difficult to understand why Colonel Conway did
not call the young man to account in some
way.
</p>

<p>
Of all these conditions Judy was fully informed
and when the autumn came, with the
general election in prospect, she directed Edgar
Coffey to find out definitely concerning the
prospective "enominations," as she and all the
rest of the mountain folk called them.
</p>

<p>
"Is that there fadey calico feller, Webb, a
goin' to be enominated fer State senator from
our distric'," she asked of her emissary when
he returned from his mission.
</p>

<p>
"No, he's a strikin' higher like. He's a
goin' to be enominated fer State senator from
this distric'; in fac' he's enominated a'ready,
an' he's mighty proud like over it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well, what's he a sayin' 'bout it?"
</p>

<p>
"He says as he's got the reg'lar Whig enomination,
an' as this is a strong Whig distric',
he's got the 'lection sure."
</p>

<p>
Judy sat silent for awhile. Then she asked:
</p>

<p>
"Is he a standin' on one leg while he's a
waitin' fer it, Edgar? 'Case ef he is he's a
goin' to git mighty tired 'fore he gits the other
foot down. You tramp over to Marcellus
McGrath's this evenin' an' tell him I want to
see him to-morrer mornin', sure. Tell him I've
got a job fer him, an' don't fergit to say he's
to do it with his head. Ef he thought 'twas
work, he would forgit to come. Git along
now. Time's money you know, though you
can't never git nobody to give you silver
change fer it."
</p>

<p>
Marcellus McGrath was the mountain
schoolmaster, who read everything from
quack medicine almanacs to patent office reports,
remembered everything he read to the
last detail, and never in his life made the smallest
use of the information with which the lumber
room he called his mind was packed full.
Facts were everything to him; the significance
of facts had never occurred to him as a thing
worthy of consideration.
</p>

<p>
He came promptly in response to Judy's
summons, and he brought with him his big,
shaggy headful of unrelated facts and figures,
more securely lodged in his memory than in
any book of reference or any table of statistics.
</p>

<p>
Judy "tapped him," as she described the
process, as soon as he had lighted his pipe after
a barbaric feast of fried chicken, jowl and
greens, pot cheese, green corn, batter bread,
cold ham, tomatoes, souse, roast venison from
Westover's camp, cucumbers, onions, apple
butter, rice pudding, apple dumplings, and ice
cream.
</p>

<p>
By way of explanation to Sapphira, while
the meal was in process of preparation, she had
said:
</p>

<p>
"Mark McGrath don't git none too much to
eat at home, I reckon, an' I'm a goin' to pump
enough facts an' figgers out'n him to leave
room for the other things."
</p>

<p>
But she did not begin the pumping process
until McGrath's pipe was comfortably lighted,
and then she did so gently at first. She had
placed a slate and pencil on a table by his side,
so that he might "figger out" anything she
wanted elucidated.
</p>

<p>
"How many voters is they in this here senate
distric'?" she asked him to begin with;
and he gave the figures promptly.
</p>

<p>
"Set that down on the slate," she directed,
and the order was obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout how many o' them is planters' votes&mdash;countin'
in the overseers an' the rest o' them
as always votes the way the planters tells 'em
to?"
</p>

<p>
McGrath thought for a brief while and then
gave his estimate.
</p>

<p>
"How many of 'em is Democratic votes?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the district is almost solidly Whig.
The Democratic vote is really a negligible
quantity," the schoolmaster, beginning to feel
his importance, replied.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't a fishin' fer big words, Mark. I's
a huntin' fer facts. Don't you make no mistake
about that. Now, tell me, how many
Democratic votes was they in the last election?"
</p>

<p>
So she went on with her catechism, making
her interlocutor set down on the slate such figures
as she wished to use in her calculations.
With these as factors she made the schoolmaster
do a deal of abstruse reckoning, the purport
and purpose of which he could not at all
conjecture, but the results of which seemed to
satisfy her, as she said at the end of it all:
</p>

<p>
"It kin be did, an' by the Hokey Pokey
Fenokey it's a goin' to be did. That little
worm-eaten, blossom-blasted chestnut of a
Webb'll wish he hadn't never let go of his hold
on the tree when Judy Peters gits through with
him. Say, Mark, what does William Wilberforce
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a name," McGrath began.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know that. But what does it mean?
Whose name was it fust off? An' what was
it he done? An' how'd that miserable little
bob-tailed rooster Webb git a hold onto it?"
</p>

<p>
Judy's antagonisms were implacable, and
they were apt to find expression in her epithets
and her metaphors. She knew next to nothing
of Webb, and she had permitted her mountaineers
to vote for him at the last preceding election.
But now that she recognized in him an
enemy of Boyd Westover, she hated him with
an intensity and an unreason possible only to
a nature such as hers, in which the primal passions
of humanity had yielded themselves to
no chastening of circumstance or civilization.
</p>

<p>
McGrath, to whom no hint of Judy's purposes
had been given, answered her questions
as if reading from a cyclopædia:
</p>

<p>
"William Wilberforce was an Englishman,
celebrated as a philanthropist and especially
distinguished by his work for the abolition of
negro slavery. He was known in England as
'the great abolitionist.'"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Judy with a grunt
of satisfaction. "I ain't got no way o' findin'
out how that bow-legged hoppergrass, Webb,
got a holt'n the name, but he'll wish't he hadn't
'fore I git through with him. Now, Mark, I
want you to write down jes' what you's tole
me&mdash;no more an' no less&mdash;'bout that there
abolitionist Wilberforce. Jest write it down
on paper an' leave it."
</p>

<p>
"What are you up to, Judy, anyhow?"
McGrath ventured to ask.
</p>

<p>
"That's what the queen bee axed the b'ar
when he clum' the bee tree, an' the b'ar says:
'I'm up to the hole that's got the honey in
it'."
</p>

<p>
And Judy vouchsafed no further explanation
of her purposes.
</p>

<p>
Next day she sent for Edgar Coffey and
questioned him.
</p>

<p>
"Who's this here Don Carlos Farnsworth
that Westover's always a sendin' game to?
Do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. He's a white man."
</p>

<p>
In the parlance of Virginia at that time there
was no phrase that meant so much as that. To
say of one that he was "a white man" was
to say that he was honest, upright, true and
loyal to the tips of his fingers. Judy perfectly
understood and so far was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Kin he talk?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well I reckon. I ain't never seed him
when he was a doin' anything else. Words
streams out'n him like water out'n a spoutin'
spring, an' they's the sort o' words that wallops
you all up an' don't leave you no chanst to
argify."
</p>

<p>
"You go down thar to-morrow, Edgar, an'
tell him please to come up here jes' as quick
as he kin, an' have dinner an' a night's lodgin'
like. Tell him I want to see him 'bout Boyd
Westover, an' ef he backs an' pulls on the halter
like, you tell him I say Boyd's in a bad way
in certain respec's. Remember to say 'in certain
respec's.' Ef you don't you'll mislead
him."
</p>

<p>
"Why not write him a letter, Judy, an' let
me carry it? Then you'd be sure."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't a writin' no letters. You see's long
as you jes' send word like, they ain't nothin'
for anybody to git a hold on. Nobody kin be
sure you said jest them words, and nobody
kin prove you didn't say 'em jes' a little differenter.
But ef you put yourself down in writin'
they's got you. No, I ain't a writin' nothin',
partic'lar when I's got a hen on the nest fer
some feller. So you jes' go down there to-morrow
an' tell Don Carlos Farnsworth I'm
a invitin' him up here on Boyd Westover's
account. Ef he says he'll come, you hain't got
no need to say no more. But ef he backs in
the traces like, you jes' tell him what I tole
you about Boyd a bein' in a bad way in certain
respec's. Remember them words an' say 'em
right&mdash;'<i>in certain respec's</i>.'"

JUDY PLANS A CAMPAIGN
</h3>

<p>
Judy's summons brought Carley Farnsworth
up into the mountains within the
fewest possible hours after she gave it to
her emissary to deliver. For Carley Farnsworth
was Westover's friend, and in Virginia
at that time friendship meant a readiness to
serve at any cost or hazard.
</p>

<p>
It was nearing supper time when Farnsworth
appeared at Judy's hospitable door and
introduced himself.
</p>

<p>
"This is Mrs. Peters, I suppose?" he said
as she confronted him.
</p>

<p>
"Judy Peters is my name," she answered
in that spirit of mountain democracy which
scorns titles and distinctions and shams of
every other sort.
</p>

<p>
Farnsworth was quick to catch the underlying
significance of her correction and both
diplomacy and humor prompted him to play
the game as she wanted it played.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I hoped for," he responded
quickly; "for Judy Peters is the very person
I most want to see in all the world just now.
I am Carley Farnsworth, Judy. Of course
Boyd has written the name 'Don Carlos' every
time he has sent me game through you, and
so you don't know me as 'Carley,' but that's
what I am to all my friends, and I count you
as one of the best of them because you're a
friend of Boyd Westover, just as I am."
</p>

<p>
"Now that's spoke up like a real, natural
young feller, an' not like a drasted stuck-up,"
responded Judy, shaking hands and bestowing
him in a porch chair where a minute later she
pressed a toddy of apple brandy upon his acceptance,
as a sure cure for the weariness he
must feel after his trapes up the mountain.
</p>

<p>
As he sipped the seductive beverage he and
she talked. But neither alluded even in the
most distant way to the occasion for his visit
or to Judy's summons, or to anything else relating
to Boyd Westover. They were both
fencing for position. Each wanted to "size
up" the other, before approaching matters of
confidence and consequence. But by the time
Judy's generous supper was at an end these
two understood each other and each trusted
the other. Judy had told him how many
"hawgs" she sent down the mountain every
year to be sold to planters, to be corn fed for
three weeks, and converted into hams, bacon,
souse, and all the rest of the good things in
which Virginian appetites revelled. She had
told him how many "bar'ls" of apple brandy
she made "in a average year," how much
cider, how much vinegar, and where her market
was for all these things. Incidentally she
had given him her picturesque opinions upon
many questions of human character, life and
conduct, and he in his turn had told her everything
he could think of, concerning himself.
</p>

<p>
"Now you an' me's acquainted," Judy said
when she thought the time ripe for the revelation
of her plans. "You's the sort o' feller
to git acquainted with, easy an' natural like,
'case you ain't got nothin' to keep up your
sleeve, an' you ain't got up in a lot o' shams
an' frills. You is straight goods, Carley, all
wool, a yard wide an' dyed in the hanks. May
be it's 'cause you's a real 'ristocrat what don't
need to keep on tellin' 'bout it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for the compliment, Judy,"
said Farnsworth, interrupting.
</p>

<p>
"They ain't no compliment to thank anybody
for," she replied. "They ain't never no
compliments a flyin' about when Judy Peters
is mixed up in the talk; or ef they is they's
purty apt to git holes punched in 'em. Ef I
thought you was a palaverin' liar, Carley, I'd
tell you so straight out. Ef I thought you was
a feller what would say one thing an' do another,
you'd hear that opinion from Judy
Peters's lips, an' what's more you wouldn't
hear none o' the things I axed you to come up
here to hear about. Now le's git down to business,
as the feller said when the sheriff was
slow about a hangin' of him. You see, Carley,
Boyd Westover's had a shakin' up, an' he ain't
right in his sperits. He's got a notion into his
head that folks is down on him an' all that.
S'long as he's up there a huntin' an' fishin' an'
listenin' to Theonidas's yarns an' sleepin' tight
he's all right. But that notion 'bout folks a
bein' down on him is still a stickin' in his mind,
like mutton gravy sticks in the roof of your
mouth, an' you an' me's got to cure him of it.
I's already laid out plans, an' ef you're game
to help me, we'll rub that thing off'n his slate."
</p>

<p>
"I'm game to help you, Judy, in any way
you like. You may bet all the apple brandy
you've got on that."
</p>

<p>
"Is that a hint, like? Does you want another
nip? 'Cause ef you do, it'll be here
quicker'n lightnin'."
</p>

<p>
"No, Judy. I don't want another dram,
and I never indulge in hints, especially with a
straightforward person like you. If I wanted
a drink I'd tell you so, but in fact I hardly ever
taste liquor of any sort, and that toddy you
gave me was the first I've sipped in a year or
more."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's curious, but they's a good many
young men nowadays as don't take to their
drams natural like. I s'pose it's all right, but
I don't understand it. Anyhow, that's no matter.
As I was a sayin', Boyd Westover's got
that notion in his head 'bout folks a bein' down
on him, an' it'll come back to him when the
snow drives him down out'n the mountings.
Now the way to cure him of it's to git him
'lected to somethin', an' I's got the somethin'
picked out. When he fin's as folks has voted
for him agin t'other feller, he jes' naturally
can't go on a thinkin' folks is down on him.
See?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see that, and your idea is a good
one, Judy, if we can get him to run for some
office."
</p>

<p>
"Git him to run? We won't ax him. We'll
jes' run him ourselves, an' we'll 'lect him too,
ef the big figgers tops the little ones as I's
always seed 'em do in a 'lection count."
</p>

<p>
Judy was apt to be confident in her predictions,
chiefly for the reason that she never
made a prediction till she knew all the facts
that might bear in any way upon its fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I wanted to see you about,
Carley. This is the way of it. You kin help,
an' I'm a bettin' my fingers agin fishhooks
you'll do it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good bet, Judy," he interrupted.
"I'd do anything imaginable for Westover,
and, now that I know you, I'd do even more
than that for you. Go on. What's your
plan?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see that measly little soap-locked
sap-head, William Wilberforce Webb&mdash;they's
more name to the man than man to
the name&mdash;has gone an' got hisself enominated
fer the Senate. That suits me down to
the ground. You an' me is a goin' to beat him
out'n his boots, an' 'lect Westover in his stid.
That's the game an' the way the wind blows,
an' the lay o' the land."
</p>

<p>
"But, Judy, can we do it? You see Webb
has secured the regular Whig nomination, and
this is a strong Whig district."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," answered Judy, confident
of the "figgerin'" she had made Marcellus
McGrath do on her slate. "You see it's this
a'way. The Democrats ain't got no chanst to
'lect a man o' their own, but they're a layin'
low to rip the righteousness out'n the reg'lar
Whig candidate ef they git the chanst, an' you
an' me's a goin' to give 'em the chanst. We'll
enominate Westover as a 'Independent Whig
candidate' an' every Democrat in the distric'
'll vote for him. They won't be no Democrat
candidate."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure of that, Judy? With two
Whigs running they might think they had a
chance to slip a Democrat in."
</p>

<p>
"They mout, of course, but they won't,"
answered Judy, confidently. "I's seen to that.
You don't s'pose Judy Peters was borned day
before yesterday, do you, Carley?" Then,
without waiting for him to protest a greater
respect for her age and experience, she continued:
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't wonder ef the Democrats got
some local offices this year. You see the mounting
vote is uncertain. Anyhow, they won't
enominate anybody for the Senate; or, yes
they will. They's a makin' the enomination
to-day. But after you an' me has got Westover
a goin' their candidate will withdraw hisself
an' urge all Democrats to vote fer Westover
an' 'lect him. You see the Democrat vote
is a leetle more'n twenty-five per cent. in this
Senate distric'. I got Marcellus McGrath to
figger that out. An' twenty-five per cent. is
a quarter, Mark says, an' he knows. Now the
vote up here in the mountings is more'n half
o' the whole, 'cause us folks up here raises
more children than the planter people does.
They ain't no profit in boastin', but I kin tell
you jes' confidential like, that ef Judy Peters
lets her tongue git too loose an' the secret slips
out that she wants Boyd Westover 'lected, you
could count on your fingers an' toes the votes
the other feller'd git up here in the mountings.
Seems to me like a sure thing, Carley."
</p>

<p>
With that Judy chuckled in satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"But you've hearn talk o' 'moral effec','
haven't you, Carley?"
</p>

<p>
Farnsworth intimated that he had some
small perception of the meaning of the terms,
and Judy went on:
</p>

<p>
"Well, what you an' me's a playin' for is
moral effec' on Boyd Westover. As fer 'lectin'
him, they won't be no trouble 'bout that. But
ef the moral effec' is to be strong, we mus' git
the biggest vote we kin for him down among
the plantation people. Fust off, then, he's got
to be enominated by that sort o' folks, without
no hint o' Judy Peters or the mountings in it.
That's your fust job. You go down there,
sayin nothin' 'bout Judy Peters or the mountings,
an' git a lot o' the stuck-ups to jine you
in enominatin' him."
</p>

<p>
In those days the "Reformers" who plead
for independence in politics had not yet invented
their ingenious devices for compelling
the voter to make a choice of evils in deciding
for whom he would vote. There were no
such things as "official ballots" limiting the
choice of the voter to men formally nominated.
Every man was free, as every man everywhere
ought to be, to vote for whomsoever he pleased
without consulting an "Australian" ballot
sheet to find out what men he was permitted
to vote for. And any man who aspired to
office was at liberty to announce his candidacy
in person or through friends as an appeal to
his fellow citizens for their free suffrages, without
asking permission of any caucus or boss
or primary or convention, and without the
necessity of spending money corruptly in order
to secure the privilege of being voted for if his
fellow citizens wished to vote for him.
</p>

<p>
Judy continued:
</p>

<p>
"When you git all the big-bug signatures
you kin, jest send a nigger round to post up the
enomination papers everywhere. Have 'em
printed, Carley, 'cause print sort o' carries
weight, an' printin' don't cost much, an' even
ef it did, 'twouldn't make no difference, 'cause
I'd pay the bill."
</p>

<p>
"You can't do that, Judy. Westover's
friends down there'll attend to that. I'll have
twenty or twenty-five signatures to the paper,
and I'll have five or six hundred printed, so as
to post one on every gate post and every tree
that anybody's likely to look at. How many
do you want, for use in the mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all! Not one!" answered Judy,
emphatically. "They won't be needed up here,
'cause I'm a takin' care o' the mounting vote,
an' I ain't a sayin' nothin'. Let 'em keep a
guessin' 'bout how the mountings is a goin'
till they hears the answer to the riddle when
the polls is closed. You see ef they find out
the mountings is agin 'em they'll try to do
somethin' up here, an' ef they's uncertain they
won't care to stir up things. But besides all
that, there's the drymatic climax to think of.
Tom Hardaway tole me all about that wunst,
so I know what a drymatic climax is, an' I
mean to have one this time, jest for the sake
o' that banty rooster, William Wilberforce
Webb, who'll find all his tail feathers pulled
out by the roots when the 'lection's over."
</p>

<p>
It will perhaps be inferred from Judy's utterances
that her hatreds were implacable as
her likings were limitless. For explanation it
is only necessary to remember that Judy Peters
was an entirely natural person, unaffected by
any of the agencies of civilization. To her, in
sentiment and emotion, compromises were as
impossible as concessions; qualifications as unthinkable
as cowardice itself&mdash;and there was
no cowardice in Judy. Toward those whose
conduct had aroused neither animosity nor
affection in her soul, she was always fair with
a frankness that had no hypocrisy and no reserve
in it; toward those whom she cherished
as friends her loyalty was of a sort that knew
no bounds and asked no questions; toward
those whom she recognized as her enemies, and
still more toward those who were the enemies
of her friends, she cherished a malevolence that
knew no mercy and that stopped at nothing
in the accomplishment of its malignant purposes.
</p>

<p>
Such was Judy&mdash;a typical representative of
the human animal in his untamed and natural
state.
</p>

<p>
"Then they's another thing, Carley, an' it's
fust an' foremost in my thinkin'."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Judy?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's this aways. You see you an'
me's a workin' an' a plannin' to bring Westover
round all right again. Now the 'lection
'11 do a mighty sight that way, but 'twon't do
it all. What Boyd needs is a good, hard fight,
an' that's what you an' me's got to give him.
He ain't to know nothin' 'bout the way the
'lection's a goin' when he hears of his enomination.
He ain't to know as how Judy Peters
had anything to do with it. He's jest to be
told as how a lot o' you stuck-ups has enominated
him, and how nobody knows where he's
a been, an' how they's a sayin' an' a insinuatin'
all sorts o' things, an' specially that he's afeard
to face his constituents. That'll stir up all the
fightin' blood they is in him, an' they's apt to
be a lot o' that sort o' blood in a Westover.
It'll set him hot when he gits down your way,
an' from then tell the 'lection's over he'll fight
like a catamount when a dozen hounds gits
him cornered. That's what he needs, an' when
the thing's over, an' he fin's himself 'lected by
a large majority, an' sees that water-soaked
piece o' cheap soap that calls hisself William
Wilberforce Webb a slinkin' off into his hole
like a drownded rat, he won't git to thinkin'
agin' that folks is down on him."
</p>

<p>
Judy's metaphors were a trifle mixed perhaps,
but her rhetoric had behind it an intensity
and a sincerity of purpose that left her auditor
in no doubt as to her meaning.
</p>

<p>
"Judy, you're a brick!" exclaimed Carley
Farnsworth rising and grasping her hand.
"You've got blood in your veins, and sand in
your gizzard, and a headpiece on your shoulders.
I'm with you, all over and clear through.
I'm going back down the mountain to-morrow
morning. I'll get the nomination papers out,
and I'll speak three times a day for Westover.
I never made a speech in my life, but I can do
it now, and all between the speeches I'll talk.
The words'll flow out of me like water through
a mill-tail. And one thing more, Judy; I'm
a little fellow, as you know. I don't weigh
a hundred and ten pounds, I'm only five feet
three in my shoes, but I can pull a trigger.
I'll see to it that nobody says anything shameful
about Boyd Westover without being called
to an interview with me at ten paces."
</p>

<p>
So was the compact made. Judy went inside
and brewed a bowl of hot apple toddy
which she insisted that Carley should share
with her "jes' to bind the bargain," she said,
and Carley, unused as he was to such indulgence,
took the risk of a next morning's headache
by drinking fair with her.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap19"></a>
XIX
<br />
THE BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN
</h3>

<p>
Carley Farnsworth never did
anything by halves. His methods were
those of one engaged in killing snakes.
When he undertook the accomplishment of a
purpose he tirelessly left nothing undone that
might in the smallest degree assist in that accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
In this case he appealed personally and
quietly to all the planters in the district to aid
in the choice of a man of their own class to
represent them in the upper house of the Legislature,
instead of a shifty lawyer of "insecure
antecedents, unripened position, and as yet unproved
character." That was the careful
phrase he had framed for use while trudging
down the mountain, and he used it so effectively
that he soon had a score of the most influential
names in all that region appended to
his announcement of Boyd Westover's candidacy.
</p>

<p>
But he was not satisfied with that. He reminded
the two store keepers at the Court
House that Westover's constituency represented
in a large degree the purchasing capacity
of the region, and the two store keepers, alert
to conserve their own interests, not only signed
the nomination announcement, but secured a
number of other and humbler signatures, and
made of their stores a species of campaigning
centres in Westover's interest, thus giving a
needed flavor of democracy to the aristocratic
appeal to the planters to "choose for their
senator a man whose character, attainments
and social position render him fitly representative
of the district and its people."
</p>

<p>
Carley Farnsworth was a doctor in large
practice. As such he was versed in what he
called "the gospel of keeping the mouth shut."
Accordingly he made his preliminary canvas
silently, secretly and with so little ostentation
that neither Webb nor any of his friends
dreamed of what was going on. Their first
intimation of it was the discovery one morning
that the nominating placards were posted on
the court house doors, all over the fronts of
all the blacksmiths' and wheelrights' shops, on
all the school houses, on the posts of every gate
that was licensed to obstruct a public road, and
upon every conspicuous tree in the piedmont
part of the Senate district.
</p>

<p>
For Carley Farnsworth had adopted Judy
Peters's view of "drymatic effect," and had
had all his placards posted between midnight
and morning of a single day.
</p>

<p>
The dramatic effect was instantly apparent.
All tongues were set wagging and before another
night came everybody in the region
round about knew that Boyd Westover was
a candidate for the Senate, nominated in his
absence and supported by many of the most
influential men in the community.
</p>

<p>
What it meant, nobody knew, and everybody
asked everybody else. Those who asked Carley
Farnsworth got for reply:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is only that some of us think we
ought to have a fitter man than Webb to represent
us in the Senate, and we've nominated
Westover without his knowledge or consent."
</p>

<p>
"But where is he?" was sure to be the next
question. "Is he afraid to face the public?"
</p>

<p>
"No," Carley answered in every case. "If
you get it into your head that Boyd Westover
is afraid of anything or anybody, you'll be as
badly mistaken as if you'd burnt your boots.
He's away on a hunting and fishing expedition,
just now, and he knows nothing of his nomination.
When we notify him of it he'll be here
to face anything or anybody, and in the meanwhile
there are some others of us who are prepared
to do any 'facing' that may be necessary."
</p>

<p>
This last utterance was intended to check
unfavorable references to Boyd Westover's unfortunate
experience, and it was in the main
effective. For Carley Farnsworth, small as he
was, had a reputation as a fighting force of no
mean pretensions. Three times he had met
antagonists on the duelling field. On one of
those occasions he had seriously wounded his
foe, and then had tenderly cared for him, nursing
him back to health in his own house. On
the two other occasions his antagonists had
apologized. In still another case Carley had
shown a loftier courage. After accepting a
challenge he had said to his seconds:
</p>

<p>
"I am satisfied that I'm in the wrong in this
matter. I was entirely sincere in making the
charge for which I am challenged, but I made
it upon misinformation, and I am prepared to
withdraw and apologize for it. Communicate
that decision to my antagonist. If he still
wants a shot at me, he can have it of course."
</p>

<p>
Such was Carley Farnsworth, and in view
of the veiled warning his words gave, it was
felt that an extreme discretion in discussing
matters pertaining to Westover's candidacy
was, to say the least, desirable.
</p>

<p>
Yet Webb and his friends felt that something
must be done to stem the tide created
by the Westover nomination. The names appended
to it were those of such men that their
support of any candidacy in opposition, seriously
imperilled Webb's chance of election,
which until then had been regarded as a foregone
conclusion that needed no looking after.
</p>

<p>
"Something must be done," and the fact
that Colonel Conway's signature was conspicuously
absent from the nomination paper, suggested
the nature of that "something." It was
known that The Oaks and Wanalah were adjoining
plantations; that the Conways and
the Westovers had been the closest intimates
for generations; that Colonel Conway had
wearied all ears with his eulogiums of Westover's
gallantry in rescuing his daughter in
time of peril. Why then was Colonel Conway's
name absent from a list that it should
naturally have headed? Was it that he believed
in Westover's guilt in spite of the revealed
facts, as some others professed to do?
Or was there truth in the rumor, which was
vaguely floating about, that Westover had
jilted Colonel Conway's daughter?
</p>

<p>
That last suggestion was quickly negatived
in all well ordered minds by the certain knowledge
that if Westover or any other man on
earth had been guilty of such offence toward
a daughter of the house of Conway, the head
of that house would have horse-whipped the
offender in public and at the point of a pistol.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless there remained the fact that
Colonel Conway's name did not appear among
those nominating Boyd Westover, and that fact
greatly encouraged Webb and his adherents
when they found that they must fight tooth and
nail for an election which they had deemed
secure beyond the necessity of endeavor of any
sort. They set to work, not so much to find
out the reason for Colonel Conway's refusal
of his name, as to insinuate conjectural solutions
of that riddle that might be hurtfully
whispered into doubting ears.
</p>

<p>
"There must be something wrong in that
quarter."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't easy to explain."
</p>

<p>
"Of course Colonel Conway has his reasons,
even if he doesn't give them."
</p>

<p>
"If there wasn't something wrong, why
didn't Colonel Conway put his name first on
the list?"
</p>

<p>
These, and like things could be said without
incurring a challenge from Carley Farnsworth's
wrath, and they were diligently and
hurtfully said; hurtfully because in that community
the least suspicion that a man had been
other than chivalrous in his treatment of a
woman was damning beyond the possibility of
forgiving.
</p>

<p>
This thing troubled Carley Farnsworth
more than he liked to admit even to himself.
A good many signatures had been denied to
his nominating paper on the sole ground that
Colonel Conway had refused to sign it, and the
absence of his signature was the one effective
plea of Webb and his followers.
</p>

<p>
When Carley Farnsworth had gone to Colonel
Conway to ask his aid, the sturdy old
planter had replied:
</p>

<p>
"I have reasons of my own for not signing
your paper, Dr. Farnsworth. Please do not
ask me what they are."
</p>

<p>
To that there was no possible response. The
request with which the Colonel concluded his
reply made a peremptory end of the conversation
so far as that subject was concerned, and
so Carley Farnsworth talked of crops and the
curing of hams instead.
</p>

<p>
But Carley Farnsworth felt that this doubt,
this question, this suspicion, was a seriously
undermining influence in his campaign for his
friend, which there was no means of meeting
in Boyd Westover's absence. For, in whispers
and by questions that could not be challenged
as assertions, Webb and his followers were
suggesting that Colonel Conway was only
waiting for Westover's return before making
public the reasons that impelled him to withhold
his approval of his neighbor's candidacy,
and that the fear of Colonel Conway's wrath
was the real reason for Boyd Westover's continued
absence.
</p>

<p>
Carley's first impulse was to write to Judy
Peters, telling her that Boyd's presence was
necessary and giving her the reasons. But
upon reflection he decided that this was a case
in which Judy's objection to "puttin' things
down in writin'" was peculiarly applicable and
valid. So he sought converse with Edgar Coffey,
who, under Judy's instructions, was "a
hangin' round" the lower parts of the district,
and confided to him the urgent and explanatory
message he wished Judy to receive.
</p>

<p>
On receipt of the message, Judy acted
promptly, but in her own way. To Edgar
Coffey she said:
</p>

<p>
"You go home now, an' look after things
there. You's got nine good hogs to kill this
fall an' your wife's a feedin' 'em on apples.
Your wife's purty, Edgar, an' her ways is
pleasin', but she ain't got the sense she was
borned with. She mixes the strippin's with the
milk jes' as ef strippin's wa'n't purty nigh the
same as cream, an' she hitches a horse to the
body of a tree, 'stead of a swingin' limb, so's
the beast can break the halter an' go home,
leavin' her to walk. She done that at church
only two weeks ago come nex' Sunday. An'
now she's a feedin' hogs on apples when she
orter be a givin' 'em corn to harden the meat
fer killin' time. So you better go home an'
fix things. I'll ten' to the rest."
</p>

<p>
Edgar was grievously disappointed. He
had confidently hoped to be himself Judy's
messenger to Boyd Westover, but Judy was
much too sagacious to permit that.
</p>

<p>
"Boyd'll ax questions," she reflected,
"'cause he'll be full o' wonderment 'bout this
here thing, an' Edgar mout let the right answers
slip out. Theonidas can't do that, 'cause
he don't know nothin' 'bout the answers."
</p>

<p>
She expected Theonidas to visit her that evening
to secure a bag of corn meal that she
knew he and Boyd sorely needed. She would
send her message by Theonidas, therefore, and
would leave the message to take the place of
the meal.
</p>

<p>
It was supper time when Theonidas arrived,
bringing a wild turkey gobbler and a dozen
squirrels on his back.
</p>

<p>
"Them's all right," said Judy, feeling of
the game. "Tell Boyd he'd orter 'a' saved
'em to take to Wanalah to-morrow. He'll be
a entertainin' folks there an' it 'ud 'a' been
handy to have some game in the house."
</p>

<p>
"He ain't a thinkin' o' comin' down the
mounting yit," replied the boy in open eyed
wonder.
</p>

<p>
"I know he ain't," Judy replied. "But
when you git back up there to-night&mdash;an'
you's a goin' to start back soon's you git yer
supper&mdash;he'll <i>be</i> a thinkin' about it, an' 'twon't
take much thinkin' to set them legs o' his'n a
movin'. You come an' git your supper, an'
then mosey up the mounting as fast as yer feet
kin foller one another. An' you're to tell Boyd
that they's the devil to pay an' no funds, down
Wanalah way. Tell him I says he's got to git
down thar' quick an' face the music."
</p>

<p>
"What's it all about, Mammy?" asked
Theonidas with not unnatural curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"That ain't none o' your business," Judy
replied, "an' ef you don't know nothin' you
can't git it wrong in tellin' it. You jes' say
what I's tole you to say, an' by midnight he'll
be a stumblin' down the mounting to find out
what's the matter. But tell him&mdash;now <i>mind</i>,
Theonidas, an' listen to what I's a sayin'&mdash;"
for the boy was reaching across the table for
a second helping of some dish he specially relished,
and Judy feared that he was not attending
to her instructions&mdash;"listen to what I's
a sayin'&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I's <i>is</i> a listenin', Mammy," the boy replied.
"I's heard every word."
</p>

<p>
"Is you? Then what was it I said last?"
she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You said as how that by midnight he'd be
a stumblin' down the mounting to find out
what's the matter."
</p>

<p>
"Right you is!" said Judy approvingly.
"Now that's business, an' so is what I'm a
goin' to say. You is to tell him <i>not to come
near Judy Peters's place</i>. Tell him they's reasons.
Tell him to go down t'other road Arricktown
way. It's shorter an' quicker, but tell
him they's reasons besides the shortness an'
quickness. An' when you's tole him all that
tell him your Mammy says he kin count on her
tell death! That'll cheer him up, like."

<br />
THE SATISFACTION OF W. W. WEBB
</h3>

<p>
When William Wilberforce Webb
found that he had to fight for an
election which he had supposed to
be securely his by virtue of his regular nomination
as the candidate of the dominant party,
he hastily called his friends and advisers together
for consultation.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the discussion it was decided
that the weak spot in Webb's campaign lay in
his neglect to do anything to secure the mountain
vote.
</p>

<p>
"We'll divide about even down here," said
the shrewdest politician among Webb's following.
"You see the whole Democratic vote is
just so much withdrawn from Westover's
strength among the planters, and the Democrats
seem to be in earnest this year. That
leaves us with a small but secure majority in
this part of the district. The decision will
rest with the mountain vote, and so far as I
can see we've done nothing to secure that."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't thought it necessary," answered
Webb, "until now. You see the mountain
people have seemed entirely indifferent, and
they seem so now. As they gave me a big
majority at the last election, I have reckoned
upon party lines to give me a like majority
this time."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Judy Peters?" asked one
of the advisers.
</p>

<p>
"No. I have taken the mountain vote for
granted, as about three-fourths Whig and one-fourth
Democratic. You see none of us expected
this intrusion of Boyd Westover into
the campaign."
</p>

<p>
"No, none of us expected it," answered another,
"but we've run up against the unexpected,
and we've got to meet it. Webb,
you've got to go up and see Judy Peters. If
you please her she'll settle the election out of
hand, but if you offend her, then God save us,
for no lesser power can!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," answered Webb, "but I really
don't think it necessary. I had a talk with
Edgar Coffey the other day&mdash;in fact I had
him dine with me at the hotel&mdash;and he assured
me that Judy Peters was taking no interest
in the campaign. He said Judy cares so
little about it that even he hadn't heard an expression
of opinion from her lips. So I have
taken the normal Whig majority in the mountains
for granted."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon "Foggy"&mdash;he had some other
name but nobody ever remembered it&mdash;arose
and walked twice across the floor before speaking.
He was barkeeper, constable, jailor, livery
man, faro dealer, hound-master, money
lender, note shaver, and pretty nearly everything
else that was disreputable, whether official
or unofficial, at the county seat, and in his
various capacities he was rightly supposed to
know politics and men as nobody else in the
county did. At last he turned to Webb and
asked:
</p>

<p>
"Was it yesterday or the day before, that
you were born? Because if it was longer ago
than yesterday there really can be no excuse
for your faith in Edgar Coffey. Don't you
know he was never caught telling the truth but
once in his life, and that time he was talking
in his sleep after too heavy a load of apple
jack, and took it all back as soon as he waked
up? Now my advice to you is to get your
walking boots on as quick as ever you can,
and go up to Judy Peters's for a consultation
as to the mountain vote. And you want to
mind your eye with Judy, for if you offend
her your goose is cooked and your cake's
dough."
</p>

<p>
In accordance with this suggestion, Webb
prepared himself for a journey up the mountain
road, but as he had a speaking engagement to
keep, he could not make the proposed visit
until a day later. In the meanwhile, and by
way of placation, he sent a messenger with a
note to Judy, in which he wrote:
</p>

<p>
"I feel that I have neglected my duty in not
visiting you before, but I have had my days
and nights so full of work that it has really
seemed impossible until now. I am going up
to-morrow to enjoy one of your matchless suppers
and have a talk with you about whatever
interests you. As for my campaign for the
Senate, I know your loyalty too well to doubt
that it has your approval; and now that the
intrusion of a third candidate has rendered the
result somewhat insecure in the piedmont part
of the district, I hope to interest you so far
that you will help me stir up a rousing vote in
the mountains."
</p>

<p>
Judy's sole comment on the letter was:
</p>

<p>
"They'll be a rousin' vote in the mountings
sure enough."
</p>

<p>
Then she turned to Sapphira and with a
relish in her tone, said:
</p>

<p>
"Say, Sapphiry, you an' me's got to lay ourselves
out on tomorry night's supper. They's
a candidate a comin'."
</p>

<p>
"Is he one you's a goin' to 'lect?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;to stay at home. But may be you's
noticed, Sapphiry, that whenever I picks out a
shoat to be turned into victuals next day, I always
gives that shoat fust chanst at the buttermilk,
an' see to it as how he kin jes' lay down
all night, 'longside o' more corn 'n he could
eat in a week. They ain't much difference
'twix' candidates an' shoats I reckon,&mdash;leastways
some candidates. So you an' me's jes'
got to git up a supper fer to-morry night sich
as the candidate never seen in his life before.
You go to the smoke house an' git the ham
that hangs wrong end up on the third row o'
hooks, three hams from the left end. Wash
it an' put it on to bile right away so's that it'll
have time to git firm cold. They's half a shoat
in the spring house, an' we'll wring the necks
o' some fryin'-size chickens to-night so's to
have 'em ready. To-morry's the reg'lar twice
a week churnin' day, so's that they'll be fresh
butter an' plenty o' buttermilk ef the candidate
happens to like buttermilk. I'll set a
bakin' o' bread to-morry mornin' so's we kin
have a hot loaf fer supper. As fer beat biscuit
an' batter bread, we kin make 'em when
the time comes. Say, Sapphiry, le's surprise
the candidate!"
</p>

<p>
Judy uttered that sentence with enthusiasm
and with a smile on her face. A happy thought
had come to her.
</p>

<p>
"Tain't hog-killin' time yit, nor yit 'twon't
be fer more'n a month to come, an' so nobody
ain't seen no sassage sence last winter. Le's
make some, out'n the trimmin's o' that half a
shoat! You an' me kin chop it an' season it
to-night an' it'll be extry superfine by supper
time to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you certainly is a layin' yourself out
fer that there candidate, Mammy," said Sapphira
in admiration of her mother's enthusiasm.
"Is you a goin' to give him a chanst at
your old peach and honey?"
</p>

<p>
"What! peach an' honey fer that miserable
wild mustard patch of a candidate? Well, not
ef I see it fust. Apple jack he'll drink, an'
it'll come out o' that there bar'l as was made
out o' last year's windfalls an' cullin's, at that.
They ain't no fine flavor to that slop, but it'll
make drunk come just the same, an' I reckon
that's all a half breed like Webb's got any call
to expect o' liquor. The best o' victuals ain't
none too good fer anybody as sets down to
Judy Peters's table, but politeness an' liquor
goes by favor, an' I ain't got no favor to spare
fer that doggoned counterfeit-copper cuss,
Webb."
</p>

<p>
When Webb appeared, he found Judy arrayed
in colors that the lilies of the field never
dared assume and that Solomon in all his
glory did not dream of. She had even put on
her bracelets and her breast pin of green glass,
simulating a setting of emeralds. She had
borrowed Sapphira's earrings&mdash;great golden
hoops that had cost a dollar and a quarter&mdash;and
was wearing them in honor of the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Her gorgeousness of adornment and the
barbaric lavishness of the supper she served
him, convinced Webb at the outset that her
favor was altogether his, that the mountain
vote was secure, and that in spite of all alarms
his triumphant election was as certain as any
human event could be. Perhaps Judy had intended
to create that impression on his mind.
Certainly she did nothing to correct or remove
it, and by the time supper was over Webb was
so well satisfied with things as they were that
he did not hesitate to indulge freely in the
apple jack that Judy set out for his consumption.
</p>

<p>
When she had got his tongue "loosened
up" to her liking, and not till then, she brought
the conversation around to subjects connected
with the political campaign. Webb had not
ventured to introduce those subjects earlier.
His instinct was keen enough to realize that
in Judy Peters's house Judy Peters was herself
the director of the conversation, and he had
heard, till the fact was deeply impressed on his
mind, that the person who forced the talk into
channels of his own choosing was pretty sure
to find himself snubbed and snuffed out by
some caustic and high-flavored utterance of
her majesty the Queen of the Mountains.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me 'bout your campaign, William
Wilberforce Webb," she said after he had had
a third or fourth helping of apple jack. Then
she changed her mind&mdash;or perhaps the change
had been in her mind all the while&mdash;and said:
"No, don't bother 'bout that yit. Tell me, instid
o' that, what you's a luggin' all that name
around for. I s'pose when you was a boy they
called you jes' Billy Webb. Why ain't that
a good 'nough name for you now? You see
us folks up here in the mountings ain't got
much respec' nor patience like with names
bigger'n the men what wears 'em. They was
wunst a feller come up here what called hisself
James Augustus de Forrest Hyde, an' we
run him out'n the mountings. He come back
arter a while a callin' hisself plain Jim Hyde,
an' he's been a breedin' mules successful, like,
ever since. You see when he fust come he
brought more name along than he could tote,
an' that's jest what you's a doin' with your
William Wilberforce Webb. It sounds well
down 'mong the stuck ups, but 'tain't no go up
here in the mountings. Us folks likes somethin'
plainer&mdash;somethin' like Boyd Westover."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you're right, Judy," answered
Webb flinching a little at the name of his antagonist,
"but when a man's parents have
given him a long name what's he to do
but wear it? A man's name's a part of
him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, an' it's that part us folks up here in
the mountings don't like. It's the fool part.
Why ain't 'W. W. Webb' a good enough
name fer a one-horse vehicle like you?"
</p>

<p>
It was the epithet rather than the question
that staggered Webb, but that it did stagger
him was indicated to Judy's shrewd observation
by the fact that he took three deep
draughts of the apple brandy before answering.
At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, Judy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't see," she interrupted, "an' you
ain't a goin' to make me see sense in a thing
what ain't got no sense in it."
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say&mdash;" he began again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know you was. Never mind a
sayin' it. Listen to me. Ef I'm to help you
in your canvass up here in the mountings, you's
got to shorten your name somehow. Mind I
don't say I's a goin' to help you,"&mdash;Judy's
sturdy love of truth in the abstract prompted
this qualification of what was essentially a lie
in the concrete&mdash;"but <i>ef</i> I'm to help you,
you's got to give me a shorter name 'n William
Wilberforce Webb to call you by. You see
every time I try to say anything 'bout you my
mouth gits so choked up, like, with that durned
worm fence of a name that the rest o' the
words won't come out nohow."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Judy, awfully sorry that my
name offends you. Just call me Billy hereafter."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right for me," answered Judy,
"but you was enominated by the name of
William Wilberforce Webb, an that's the way
it'll be wrote on the pollin' books. How's the
folks up here in the mountings to know as how
Billy Webb an' William Wilberforce Webb is
the same feller? The two don't sound much
alike. Howsomever we'll try an' manage that.
Now tell me 'bout how things is a goin' down
plantation ways."
</p>

<p>
In the embarrassment created by Judy's critical
reflections upon his name, Webb had filled
his large tumbler again with the insidious intoxicant,
forgetting to add water, and had
taken several swigs of the "reverend spirits,"
which is what Virginians always called undiluted
brandy or whiskey. Judy had observed
the fact but had not discouraged it. Her son,
Daniel Webster, was at home that night to put
Webb to bed if need be, and meanwhile she
wanted to find out from Webb's indiscretion
what she had no hope of learning in any other
way, namely, "all about the gal that's mixed
up in the matter."
</p>

<p>
To that end she interrupted Webb many
times, checking his tendency to indulge in
generalities and holding him down to facts.
He told her how greatly Boyd Westover's intrusive
nomination had disturbed what had
promised to be a "walk-over campaign"; how
the refusal of Colonel Conway to sign Boyd's
nomination paper was exciting suspicion, and
much else of interest to which Judy paid no
heed. She harked back instead to the Conway
matter.
</p>

<p>
"What was the matter with Conway?" she
asked. "Has him an' young Westover had
any fallin' out?"
</p>

<p>
Webb had attained that condition of alcoholic
indiscretion in which the impulse is to be
confidential and to say things far better left
unsaid. He unbosomed himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, Judy," he said, "there are
some things we don't mention, but you're a
friend of mine, Judy, and you're entitled to
my confidence. You see it's this way. The
talk is that Boyd Westover and Colonel Conway's
daughter Margaret were engaged to be
married, when Westover committed&mdash;or was
accused of committing the crime of which he
was convicted and for which he was sentenced
to the penitentiary. Some say she stood by
him and he threw her over; some suggest that
he couldn't explain things to her satisfaction&mdash;that
she asked him questions he couldn't answer;
some say he went back to Wanalah eager
to marry the girl, and she threw him over
because she didn't believe in his innocence.
You see, Judy, he is, after all's said and done,
only a pardoned criminal, and his pardon was
based only on the confession of a poor demented
fellow who has since been sent to
Staunton as a lunatic. Anyhow it's plain that
Colonel Conway believes Boyd Westover to be
guilty, just as I do and as a good many other
folks down our way do. If he isn't guilty,
why's he hiding himself? Why don't he come
into the district and face the music, instead of
leaving that little monkey, Carley Farnsworth,
to do everything for him? You never saw
Carley Farnsworth, did you, Judy? Of
course you didn't. Well, he's a little jackanapes
of a doctor that's equally ready to give
his blue pills by the mouth or at the point of
a pistol. Boyd Westover has put him forward
to overawe and intimidate everybody; but the
Democrats will hold their vote this year and
with your help, Judy, we'll make this election
memorable."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know jest what that last word
means, Billy, but after what you's been a tellin'
me you kin bet your next winter's meat I'll
have a hand in this here 'lection."
</p>

<p>
Judy never made promises that she did not
fulfil. But if a candidate misinterpreted the
phrases she used in making promises, she
stoutly held that the fault was his and not
hers.
</p>

<p>
"My words is good for what they call fer,"
she was accustomed to say, "but good money
don't stand fer no counterfeits."
</p>

<p>
When she had got all she wanted out of
Webb, she sent that worthy to bed, satisfied
in his soul with things as they were, and as
confident of the mountain vote in his behalf
as of the excellence of Judy's cookery and the
exhilaration that resided in her apple jack.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

XXI
<br />
FLAGS FLYING
</h3>

<p>
Judy was right in her reckoning as to the
effect of her blind message upon the mood
and movements of Boyd Westover. It
was not far from midnight when Theonidas
reported what his mother had said, and although
the night was one of extreme darkness
and a drizzling rain was falling, Boyd Westover
set out at once to stumble down the precipitous
mountain path to the scarcely less precipitous
mountain road three miles away, and
thence down, down, down, to whatever level
the road might ultimately reach.
</p>

<p>
As he had never journeyed over that road
before, and as its perils by night were very
real and very great, Theonidas besought him
to postpone the start until the dawn, but he
refused to heed, and bidding the boy transfer
the camp equipments to Judy Peters's house,
to await orders, set off with the energy of a
madman. Yet he had never been saner in all
his life or in better condition to meet difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The delphic character of Judy's message left
him, of course, in doubt as to the occasion of
the talk about himself and to his detriment in
his own neighborhood, but from the first he
had not a shadow of doubt as to the substance
and subject of that talk. He knew without
telling that his fellow men had found some occasion&mdash;he
could not guess what&mdash;for discussing
his character and conduct and for recalling
to his disadvantage his conviction of
crime, his pardon and all the rest of it.
</p>

<p>
But he faced this sort of thing now in very
different mood from that which had been his
a few weeks before. Where before his impulse
had been to shrink away from the horror, his
mood now was to seek it out, to dare it, to
defy it, to fight it with all the determination
of a vigorous manhood aroused to self defence
and not averse to vengeance. Where before
he had instinctively sought solitude as a refuge,
his impulse now was to seek the haunts of his
fellow men, to challenge the criticism that had
before so appalled him, to face the world with
head erect and dare Fate to meet him hand to
hand, foot to foot, eye to eye in combat.
</p>

<p>
The simple fact was that he had ceased to
be morbid. In his life up there among the
mountain tops he had regained his health of
mind and body. In his contests with Nature's
forces and his triumph over them in a thousand
petty ways, he had become normal again. He
was no longer the introspective, morbidly self-conscious
victim of adverse circumstance that
Judy Peters had found him to be, but a strong
man rejoicing in his strength, a Westover of
Wanalah who shrank from no danger and
blanched in no foe's presence. He tramped
down the mountain through six or seven hours
of darkness in eager quest of those malignities
from which he had before sought escape in a
refuge of solitude. He wanted now to hear
and combat the criticism from the very thought
of which he had before been moved to flee in
something like terror.
</p>

<p>
It was in this mood that he encountered the
first news of what had happened. It presented
itself in the shape of one of Carley Farnsworth's
nominating placards, tacked to the
great hewn log posts of a gate that spanned
the road, and Westover, after nearly twenty
miles of tramping, came upon it about sunrise.
He could not imagine what to make of it, and
after a minute's consideration he dismissed it
as somebody's practical joke&mdash;a part perhaps
of that "devil to pay" in his own neighborhood
of which Judy Peters had sent him
warning.
</p>

<p>
But as he continued his journey he found
the thing repeated on every gatepost, on every
conspicuous tree by the roadside, and all over
the front of a blacksmith's shop which he had
to pass.
</p>

<p>
There was nobody in the shop to answer
questions at that early hour, but at that point
the road forked, one arm of it leading to Wanalah
and the other to Chinquapin Knob, the
home of Carley Farnsworth. It was only three
miles from that point to Wanalah, and it was
full five miles to Chinquapin Knob, but, weary
as his legs ought to have been and were not,
after his twenty odd miles of tramping over
rough roads, he turned his face not toward
Wanalah but in the opposite direction, resolving
to take breakfast with Carley Farnsworth
at Chinquapin Knob. He quickened his pace
too, after a glance at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"It's half-past six," he said to himself, "and
Carley has the barbaric habit of breakfasting at
eight. I must do the five miles in an hour and
a half, if I don't want a breakfast of leftovers,
and this morning I don't."
</p>

<p>
As he trudged on up a glutinous red clay
hill road, it began to rain again in dismal fashion,
but the fact did not depress him.
</p>

<p>
"It'll make the clay road soapy," he reflected,
"so I must put a little more vim into
my leg motions if I'm to do the trick on time."
</p>

<p>
With that he added ten or a dozen steps per
minute to his pace and thought no more about
the matter.
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover was himself again. That
was all.
</p>

<p>
Tree after tree, as he passed on, confronted
him with a repetition of the announcement that
"We the undersigned, deeming it desirable
that," etc., etc., "hereby nominate Boyd Westover,
Esq., of Wanalah, for election as the
representative of this Senate district in the
upper house of the Legislature, and we appeal
to the pride and patriotism of our friends,
fellow citizens and neighbors," and so on to
the end of the chapter of Carley Farnsworth's
free flowing rhetoric. Westover did not pause
to look at any of them. There was no need.
He had already learned what the placards proclaimed,
and he had already observed the conspicuous
absence of Colonel Conway's name
from the list of those who thus urged his election.
He could no more guess the meaning of
its absence than others had been able to do,
but he was not surprised by the fact. In view
of Colonel Conway's failure to call upon him
during the days of his late stay at Wanalah,
he would have been astonished if that gentleman's
name had appeared on the paper. But
his mood was not now what it had been before.
He was no longer disposed to be submissive
even to Fate, or to reconcile himself to its unjust
decrees. As he strode onward at the pace
he had set himself he reflected:
</p>

<p>
"Of course Colonel Conway was under no
obligation to call upon me, except the obligation
of old friendship, and that he was free to
regard as cancelled, if he chose. And of
course he was under no obligation to sign that
nominating paper, if he did not wish. But he
knew that his failure to call upon me was a
conspicuous neglect to which others would attach
importance, and he knew that his refusal
to sign the paper would be everywhere interpreted
as an accusation that must put shame
upon me. I have a right to demand a greater
explicitness of accusation, and I will. His
silence does me a greater hurt than any other
man's utterance could. I have a right to challenge
it on the ground of its injustice. I have
a right to insist that he shall speak, and I will
make that demand and enforce it."
</p>

<p>
Obviously Boyd Westover had recovered his
vigor and was again fit to call himself by the
name his forebears had borne for generations
past&mdash;Westover of Wanalah&mdash;a name which
in that community had always stood for virility,
courage and uncompromising honor; a
name that had meant secure peace to those who
deserved peace and quick war to those who
were hostilely disposed; a name that had always
represented what is best in manhood,
both in its tenderly forbearing gentleness of
impulse and its relentless strength of purpose.
</p>

<p>
As he approached Chinquapin Knob the evidences
of his candidacy rapidly multiplied.
The outer gate of Carley Farnsworth's plantation
was plastered all over with the nomination
placards, and as the house came into view Boyd
saw a great flagstaff there carrying in the
breeze three long tailed streamers on which,
as he presently made out, were inscribed the
legends:
</p>

<p>
"For Senator&mdash;Boyd Westover!"
</p>

<p>
"Vote for a Gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"Westover of Wanalah!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand it," Westover reflected
as he climbed the last hill and saw by a glance
at his watch that he was a quarter of an hour
ahead of his scheduled time, "I don't understand
it, but obviously I'm a candidate for
Senator and with equal obviousness I'm in
for a fight if I am to win. So much the better.
I don't care a fig about the Senatorship, but
I'll enjoy the fight. I'm in the mood for it.
And besides I like to win the game, whatever
the stake may be. I'll fight for this election
as I never fought for anything before in my
life. I wonder who the other fellow is, anyhow&mdash;my
opponent?"
</p>

<p>
Clearly his twenty-five mile walk, made between
midnight and breakfast time, had not
robbed Boyd Westover of any of the vigor of
mind and temper that were his by inheritance
and that the mountains had given back to him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm almost famished," he said to himself.
"It suddenly occurs to me that I was out after
a catamount last night and forgot all about my
supper. I wonder if Carley has a roe herring
for my breakfast. Anyhow he'll have a lot of
other good things."
</p>

<p>
As he finished his wondering he entered the
house grounds at Chinquapin Knob, and Carley
Farnsworth, who was smoking his before-breakfast
pipe in the porch, caught sight of
him.
</p>

<p>
Their greetings and questions were like shots
from a rapid fire gun, an implement of slaughter
which had not then been invented by the
devilish ingenuity of greed in the service of
murder.
</p>

<p>
Out of the cross fire Carley Farnsworth
managed to extract the information that his
friend had been tramping since midnight with
a stomach empty since noon of the preceding
day.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he exclaimed. "Excellent!
You're altogether fit. You're in shape or you
never could have done that. But I won't answer
any question you can conceivably ask"&mdash;for
Boyd had already begun a clamorous catechism
as to what it all meant&mdash;"until we've
had breakfast and a pipe. Enos!" addressing
a negro boy, "go to the kitchen and tell Elsie
there'll be a lot of trouble at Chinquapin Knob
if breakfast isn't on the table in five minutes,&mdash;do
you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me, Carley, what all this means,"
pleaded Westover.
</p>

<p>
"I'll do nothing of the kind until after
breakfast," answered the other. "I'm a doctor
you know, and I have the honor to be the
family physician at Wanalah. By the way,
Boyd, you've got three cases of typhoid in your
lower quarters, and as I suspected the well
I've ordered it filled up, and the negroes down
there are carrying their water half a mile or
so. That isn't what I wanted to talk about.
As your family physician I have your health
in charge. You're in superb condition now,
and it's my business to keep you so. You've
made a long tramp on an empty stomach&mdash;a
very unwise thing to do, but as a doctor I'm
used to that sort of thing. There wouldn't
be any serious work for us doctors to do, if
people generally were wise. But you've made
a tremendous draft upon your bank account
of vigor, and it is time for you to make a deposit
to keep the account good. You need
breakfast, before you burden your mind even
with anything I have to say. And by the way,
Johnny is bringing in the breakfast two whole
minutes before the time. There's the loaf of
hot light bread, and the roe herrings and the
biscuits and the batter bread. There's a cold
ham on the dresser and the batter cakes or
waffles or something of that kind will come in
later. Kizzy, my housekeeper, is making the
coffee; she always does that the last thing in
order that it may be fresh. She frequently
utters the dictum, 'Coffee ain't no good ef
you don't drink it while the aromatics is in it.'
I don't know where she got that word, but
there is always a supply of delicious 'aromatics'
in Kizzy's coffee. Come. Here's a cold
jowl if you care for it, and there's sausage
before you, and liver and chidlings&mdash;you see
I killed half my hogs the other day. Eat your
breakfast and make it a good one. If you
don't I'll refuse to tell you any of the interesting
things you're so anxious to hear about."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<br />
AN UNMISTAKABLE CURE
</h3>

<p>
When the breakfast was over and,
with long-stemmed pipes alight, the
two friends foregathered in front of
a blazing fire&mdash;for the drizzling autumn day
was chill&mdash;Westover again demanded to
know "what all this thing means."
</p>

<p>
"You must have seen some of the placards?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Some</i> of them? It seems to me that all
the woods have been papered with them. But
what does it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's obvious enough. It means that
a goodly number of your neighbors and friends
have nominated you for Senator, moved thereto
by a conviction that the intelligence and character
of the district deserve a better representative
than William Wilberforce Webb."
</p>

<p>
Farnsworth was careful not to suggest Judy
Peters's initiative or interest in the matter.
That was a secret between him and her.
</p>

<p>
The mention of Webb's name as that of his
opponent, started Westover out of his chair,
and as he stood upon the hearth he said, in
tones that were kept in subjection by sheer
force of a resolute will:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then it is Webb I'm running against.
That puts a new face on the affair. I like that.
Against him I'll make a whirlwind campaign.
But how on earth did that fellow manage to
secure a nomination by so respectable a party
as the Whigs?"
</p>

<p>
"Chiefly by general neglect. He worked for
the nomination and all the rest of us let it go
to him by default. That's the substance of the
story."
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered Westover, "the news that
he is my opponent gives me a new and eager
interest in the campaign. We'll get up squirrel
stews and barbecues, late as the season
is, and militia musters and every other kind of
thing that draws men together, and I'll make
my little, red hot speech at all of them. Is
there anything in sight?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing available, so far as your presence
is concerned. This is Court day, of course,
and I'm going to make a speech&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So am I," interjected Westover.
</p>

<p>
"But how can you? You've tramped all
night and I've ordered a bath and a bed for
you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you sincerely. I'll enjoy the bath
and the bed some other time. To-day I'm going
to the Court House with you. I'll ride
one of your plugs, if you don't mind, and may
be you'll send a boy over to Wanalah with a
note to my overseer. I want him to send a
horse to the Court House to meet me&mdash;a real
horse that I'll have a fight with every time I
come to a gate."
</p>

<p>
Carley Farnsworth did not answer immediately.
Instead he walked into the dining room
under pretence of refilling his pipe&mdash;really for
the sake of a good chuckle over his friend's
condition.
</p>

<p>
"He's as fit as a fiddle," he said to himself.
"He's full of vigor and full of fight. He's
Westover of Wanalah again, and that's what
I've been working for. That mountain air,
and the hunting and fishing and rough tramping
have done more for him than all the calomel,
quinine and strychnine I've got in my
saddle bags could do. It's great! And we'll
crown the cure&mdash;Judy and I&mdash;by making
him Senator. Really Judy is a great diagnostician
in her way. It was she who found out
what was the matter with Boyd and prescribed
the remedy. I used to think she had only one
medicine, that apple jack was her panacea. I
know better now."
</p>

<p>
Then, with his pipe refilled, he returned to
the parlor only to find it empty. Going to the
porch he saw Westover astride a three-year-old
filly that had been turned loose to graze in
the house grounds. Without saddle or bridle
the young man was gaily cavorting on the
spirited mare's back and rapidly reconciling her
to control of his will.
</p>

<p>
"Well, certainly he's fit," muttered the little
doctor. "There aren't many men in Virginia
who would prefer that sort of thing to a comfortable
bed after an all night's tramp down a
mountain side, over the roughest roads that
adverse natural conditions, supplemented by the
evil ingenuity of road supervisors, ever managed
to create. Houp la! I'll dismiss him as
cured. But we'll go on and elect him."
</p>

<p>
Then, as the negro boy for whom he had
sent appeared, Farnsworth called out:
</p>

<p>
"I say, Boyd, I've a boy waiting for you
here. Come and give him instructions."
</p>

<p>
And when Westover reached the steps, his
host added:
</p>

<p>
"Sam may as well bring your horse to the
Court House himself. It is hardly at all out
of his way in coming back. So give him your
instructions."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Go to my overseer, Sam, and
tell him to send Rob Roy to me by you. And
mind you, you are to lead him. If you try
to ride him he'll pitch you head first into the
deepest mud puddle he can find, and then he'll
go galloping home again. Tell the overseer
to put the double-bitted snaffle and curb bridle
on him and the lightest flat saddle in the stables.
And mind, Sam, keep the stirrups
crossed over the saddle. If you don't, Rob
Roy will mount himself and ride away heaven
knows where."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," answered Sam. "I hear, an'
I'll be keerful. I prides myself on ridin' anything
they is short'n a hurricane, but I's contumaciously
opposed to gittin' on the back o'
that there Rob Roy o' yourn. He's wuss'n a
hurricane an' a' earthquake an' a 'clipse o' de
moon all put togedder. Dat's my jedgment
o' his pussonal character generally. He's wuss
now, o' course."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sam?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cause he's done been stabled up fer free
or four months, now, 'thout no exercise 'ceptin'
bein' led to de branch fer water."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that, Sam? Have they kept
that horse&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I knows it. Yo' see dey ain't
nobody on Wanalah plantation dat dares git
on dat dar hoss's back, an' 'taint much fun to
exercise a hoss by leadin' of him. 'Sides
dat&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sam faltered, and his master interposed:
</p>

<p>
"Go on&mdash;'sides what."
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'taint nothin', sir."
</p>

<p>
"All right. I like to hear about nothings.
Who is she, Sam?"
</p>

<p>
"Who's who, Mastah?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the girl you've been courting over
at Wanalah? Of course I know you've been
stealing a mule out of the stables and riding
over there every night for a month without
asking my permission. But I don't know who
the girl is or whether she's worthy of you,
Sam."
</p>

<p>
"'Fore de Lawd, Mastah, I ain't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't forswear yourself, Sam. I know
all about it. I visit my stables every night,
and I've missed you and the mule. I don't
mind, only, if you had asked me, I'd have let
you have a better mule and a saddle. Never
mind that now. Take the mare Medora, and
get away from here. Bring your Mas' Boyd's
horse to the Court House, and mind you, don't
stop at Wanalah to sweetheart with Patty
Jane&mdash;for you see after all I know all about
this thing."
</p>

<p>
"And Sam, tell my body servant to send
me some clothes by you," added Westover.
</p>

<p>
When the boy had gone, in some confusion
over what seemed to him his master's supernatural
knowledge of things he had carefully
guarded against discovery, Farnsworth explained
to his companion:
</p>

<p>
"I always take pains to know what goes
on on the plantation, and I never mention it
except in sensational ways, calculated to impress
the African mind with the conviction
that as a doctor I am possessed of strange,
occult powers of discovery against which it is
useless to practise the ordinary arts of concealment.
It's a handy way to keep things
in order on a plantation, the master of which
has to attend to a medical practice. Now we
must be off. Here are our horses. I've assigned
to your use the maddest piece of horseflesh
I possess. It's a mare that broke my
overseer's arm a year ago, and when harnessed
to a vehicle for purposes of subjugation and
discipline kicked the vehicle into kindling
wood and scrap iron and then kept on kicking
till there was nothing left on her but a
collar. She'd have kicked that off too, I
reckon, if it had been behind her shoulders.
She has been a good deal tamed since then,
but she still has spirit enough to satisfy any
reasonable rider. You, of course, are unreasonable.
What's your fancy anyhow, Boyd,
for riding cataclysms and cyclones instead of
serious-minded animals that know their business
and do it docilely?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh I don't know. I like struggle, contest,
and all that. I like to match my wits
against brute strength. I like&mdash;well I suppose
I like a fight."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the two mounted.
</p>

<p>
"There's no trace of neurasthenia in him,
anyhow," thought Farnsworth. Aloud he
said:
</p>

<p>
"All that is very fortunate, for just now
you've got all the fight ahead of you that any
reasonable person of fighting temperament
could desire."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about it, Carley. I've been
trying to worm the facts out of you ever since
I got to Chinquapin Knob."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the thing's simple enough. You see
Webb hates you of course, and he's afraid of
you. When he secured the regular nomination
he thought he had his fox by the tail.
There was only the Democratic candidate,
Sam Butler, opposing him, and of course in
so strong a Whig district as this is, that candidacy
didn't count. But when we nominated
you as an independent Whig, things began to
cloud up in Webb's sky. He got ugly, but&mdash;well,
he was made to understand that there
were limits to what it would be safe to say
about you."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, Carley," said Boyd, grasping
his hand warmly; "I understand, and I
thank you from the bottom of my heart for a
friendship that has no bottom so far as plummet
line can discover. But all that's my job
now. Go on, I want to hear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he hasn't dared say a thing in any
open fashion, but there are a lot of his followers
whom no gentleman can afford to
honor by slapping their jaws or kicking them
off the steps of a barroom, and through them
Webb has managed to circulate insinuations."
</p>

<p>
"Of what sort?" asked Westover quickly.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't easy to pin them down to a definition.
They have mainly taken the form of
questions. 'Where is Boyd Westover, anyhow?
Why doesn't he present himself to the
people he asks to vote for him? What's he
afraid of? Why didn't his oldest and best
friend Colonel Conway sign the paper nominating
him? Does Colonel Conway doubt
his innocence after all? Isn't he satisfied with
the other fellow's confession? Or does he
think the confession of a lunatic insufficient?'
These are some of the questions set afloat,
nobody knows how or by whom."
</p>

<p>
"What are the others?" demanded Westover
with set teeth and a jaw that seemed to
have added to its massiveness by reason of the
determination of the mind behind it. "Go
on. Tell me the whole story. I want to know
just what I have got to fight."
</p>

<p>
"That's right, and I'll be with you in the
fight. We'll run these questions down till we
make it unsafe to ask them. I've already
made a good many people quit asking them
by notifying them that I should treat any
repetition of the questions as an assertion for
which the questioner could be and should be
and would be held responsible; confound that
grammar rule about can and will and could
and should and would, I never could remember
it, but I've given notice to all and singular
that I recognize no distinction between insinuation
and assertion in such a case as this, and
that&mdash;oh, well, you know what a notice of
that kind suggests."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I know, and I thank you. But
you're evading my question, Carley. What
is the other insinuation? I quite understand
that you shrink from mentioning it, but you
must. I have a right to demand that much
from a friendship so loyal as yours has proved
itself to be. Go on. Tell me the worst."
</p>

<p>
"I will. But the thing has been so subtilely
put forth that I've found it impossible
even to find anybody who has asked the question.
Indeed everybody who has helped to
circulate the slander has done so not by asking
if there was truth in it but by declaring
his utter disbelief in it. I never knew anything
so cleverly managed in my life, or anything
so malignant."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't yet told me what the scandal
was," said Boyd, with lips so tightly compressed
that the purple had all gone out of
them.
</p>

<p>
"In substance it amounted to this, that you
had in some way treated Colonel Conway's
daughter with unchivalrous disrespect&mdash;that
you had put some unforgivable slight upon
her&mdash;nobody suggests what. In fact the
thing is so vague and shadowy and unsubstantial
that it is difficult even to define it.
But Colonel Conway's refusal to join with us
in nominating you has lent a sort of color to
it, and this thing, utterly unsubstantial as it
is, has done more than all else to embarrass
our campaign. In your absence it has been
impossible to meet it and throttle it, for nobody
but you could have a shadow of authority
to question Colonel Conway on such a
subject."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," answered Boyd; "I'll deal
with that matter in a way that will satisfy
myself at any rate, and possibly my friends
also. Thank you for all. I know the situation
now, and knowing it, I think I know how
to meet it."
</p>

<p>
As he said this the pair were entering the
Court House village, and their road took
them within a few feet of the house and law
office of Sam Butler, the Democratic candidate
for Senator. As they passed, Butler
stepped out into the porch accompanied by
Edgar Coffey, and engaged in the earnest end
of a conversation. They could not avoid
hearing Coffey say:
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's what Judy tole me to tell you,
an' ef you do as she says, she'll take keer o'
the rest."
</p>

<p>
Neither Westover nor Farnsworth said a
word until they had passed well beyond hearing.
Then Westover exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what on earth that means!
Surely Judy Peters isn't going to throw the
mountain vote for him."
</p>

<p>
"Very certainly not," answered Farnsworth,
but he said nothing of his visit to the Queen
of the Mountains or of her initiative in Boyd
Westover's nomination.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Westover, recalling Judy's
last message to himself, "that isn't even one
of the possibilities." But he did not explain
the grounds of his confidence.
</p>

<p>
After a little, as the two rode into the stable
yard of the hotel to put up their horses, Westover
said:
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless I'd give something handsome
to know what that meant."
</p>

<p>
"So would I," answered Farnsworth.
</p>

<p>
They were destined to find out, before the
campaign ended, but not yet.
</p>

<br />
COURT DAY
</h3>

<p>
Court Day in old Virginia was an institution.
It happened once a month
and it served all the purposes of club,
exchange, political assemblage, muster, and
social meeting time. Pretty nearly the whole
adult male population of the county was sure to
be present at the county seat on that day, so
that the Virginian who wanted to see anybody,
whether to collect a note or give one, to make
a contract or to cancel one, to arrange a religious
meeting or a barbecue, to trade horses
or to exchange views concerning the latest
philosophy, to make speeches or to listen to
them, was sure to find present the people who
were in any way related to the matter he had
in hand. Those leisurely folk never thought
of bothering themselves to visit anybody on
business. Whatever the business was, it could
wait until Court Day, and it did.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes there was political speaking or
the like on Court Day, but not always. The
orators had need of an audience, and if there
was anything of interest going on in Court,
everybody was sure to be there and the orators
had nobody to address.
</p>

<p>
It was so on this occasion. It was a quarterly
Court&mdash;a grand jury term of the County
Court&mdash;and there was a murder trial of sensational
character in progress. As a result
everybody who could find a square foot of
space within the Court room, in which to
bestow his person, sought place there the
moment the Court opened, and held it tenaciously
throughout the session. The struggle
for place was all the greater because Jack
Towns, just returned from his Rocky Mountain
trip, was present as attorney and counsellor
for the accused man, and Jack Towns's
eloquence was something that everybody
wanted to hear. Besides that, his skill in confusing
a witness and reducing him to pulp was
something that nobody wanted to miss. Jack
was a lawyer whose equipment lacked little of
perfection. His learning was adequate, his
sagacity almost preternatural, and when he
had a case to conduct the Commonwealth's Attorney
was in a tremor of blue funk from the
beginning, the Judge was alertly mindful lest
his judgment should be unduly swayed by persuasive
eloquence, and the populace was in the
humor that possesses an audience when a great
star and a great company are to present a great
drama or tragedy or comedy as the case may
be.
</p>

<p>
Jack was too deeply engaged with "the
work of saving a human life," as he said, to
talk for more than half a minute with Westover,
when the two met at the stables of the
inn.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to Wanalah for the night," he
said. "Then and there we can talk. At present
I have only time to tell you that you are,
three times over, the richest man in Virginia
and that your wealth includes a practically
limitless supply of ready money. I haven't
time now to tell you more, but I tell you this
in the interest of your campaign. Give all the
jamborees you think of; let the money flow
like water, and I'll take care of the results."
</p>

<p>
"But, Jack, I'm not buying my election,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not. I understand all that. I
only want you to know that for legitimate expense
your bank account is ample. Now I
must go. I've a human life in my hands. I'll
be with you at Wanalah to-night. Go home
when you get ready. I'll be there when I can.
So long."[1]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[1] The expression "so long," as here used, is not an
anachronism. It was in use in Virginia, and in well
nigh universal use in South Carolina before the war.
Its adoption at the North came much later, I believe.

it might be a corruption of "salaam."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author.</span>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In Virginia in those old, sunny days, hospitality
was taken for granted in that confident
fashion, and the welcome always justified the
assumption.
</p>

<p>
But before the court was opened, and during
its noon recess, which was shortened to three-quarters
of an hour because of the importance
of the case at bar, Boyd Westover found it
difficult to move about, because of the besetting
eagerness of his friends to greet him. In answer
to questions he frequently repeated a little
impromptu speech.
</p>

<p>
"I was in utter ignorance of my nomination
until I saw placards this morning. I haven't
even yet found out what it means, and I really
care nothing for the place. I'd far rather stay
at Wanalah and look after my affairs. But as
my friends have nominated me I'm a candidate
and I shall stay in the race till the polls close
on election day. I learn that some persons&mdash;I
don't know who&mdash;have been suggesting
things to my detriment. I am here to ask
about that, to challenge every insinuation
against my character and every criticism of my
conduct. I stand ready to answer. I ask only
that those who seek to injure me shall come
out into the open, make themselves known and
put their accusations into definite form so that
they may be met and either refuted or established.
I don't relish attacks in the dark or
from behind masks, and I am going to make
known my opinion of the sneaks and cowards
who make such attacks. I'm going to attend
every gathering of my fellow citizens between
now and election day, and at every one of them
I'm going to challenge any and every body as
I do now, who has aught to say against my
character or my conduct to say it openly like a
man. If any one does that, I shall reply in
such fashion as I think appropriate in each
case. I stand before the community as Westover
of Wanalah, a man conscious of his own
rectitude and prepared to vindicate the honor
of the name he bears at all times, against all
comers and at all hazards. That is all I have
to say, and it ought to be enough to satisfy
honorable men and to silence sneaks and slanderers."
</p>

<p>
So far as the men of honest mind who were
gathered together that day were concerned, this
challenge seemed abundantly satisfying. Many
who had entertained doubts because of the candidate's
absence, abandoned their doubts and
frankly declared their purpose to support
Westover at the election. As for Webb and
his friends, they found themselves sorely embarrassed.
Their opportunity had lain in
Westover's unexplained absence. His appearance
now, and his frank and manly challenge,
robbed them of their weapons and their ammunition.
They dared not say aught that might
be construed into an accusation, and if any of
them insinuated aught to Westover's discredit
he was sure of a peremptory challenge to say
just what he meant.
</p>

<p>
It was obvious to Webb and his supporters
that something must be done to meet and neutralize
the effect of Boyd Westover's presence
and defiance. They still had "regularity"
behind them. Webb was the regularly nominated
candidate of the Whig party, strongly
dominant in that region, and presumably he
would receive the regular party vote. Then,
too, as he explained to his partisans, most of
the Democrats, who would of course support
their own party candidate, were men friendly
to Westover, whose votes were so many subtracted
from the support that would otherwise
be his.
</p>

<p>
"I regard Sam Butler's candidacy as a thing
altogether in my interest," he said confidently,
"and then," he jubilantly added, "I have satisfactory
assurance that the whole mountain
vote will be mine, and so I regard my election
as a foregone conclusion, a triumphant assurance
of a future that holds human affairs securely
within its grasp."
</p>

<p>
That was a phrase dear to Webb's soul.
He had spent half a night in concocting it
and committing it to memory. "You
know I've been up in the mountains, and I've
been royally entertained by Her Majesty the
Queen."
</p>

<p>
"Has she definitely promised you the mountain
vote?" asked one who had a passion for
exactitude.
</p>

<p>
"Practically, yes. You know Judy Peters
talks in parables and never commits herself;
but a wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse,
and her parting words to me left nothing of
assurance to be desired. Now what I want
to say is this: My election is secure, but I
want my constituency to include as large a proportion
of the planters, men of my own class,
as possible, and so I have accepted Sam Butler's
challenge to meet him and divide time
at the Barbecue he's going to give over at
Fighting Creek, the day after to-morrow. I
suppose Westover will be there by Sam's invitation,
and between Sam and me he won't be
left a leg to stand on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, may be so," muttered Foggy, whose
experience in politics had bred chronic scepticism
in his mind; "but Boyd Westover has
been talkin' right out in meetin' to-day, an'
besides&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Foggy?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack Towns is here, you know, an'
if he happens to make a speech over there he'll
tangle you up like a fish-line after you've
caught an eel on it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of him," answered Webb,
confidently.
</p>

<p>
"So much the worse," muttered Foggy.
"Maybe he wouldn't do you up so badly if
you were properly afraid of him. However,
we must take things as we find 'em, and candidates
likewise, and I'll be over at Fighting
Creek with a lot o' fellows to shout for you,
Webb."
</p>

<p>
When Court opened and everybody made a
rush for places in the court house, Boyd strolled
over to the inn whose proprietor insisted upon
calling it a hotel, and, going to the room he
had taken there for the day, threw himself
upon the bed for a sleep of two or three hours.
At the end of that time he arose refreshed,
took a cold sponge bath, and proceeded to
change his rough mountain costume for the
more conventional garments his body servant
had sent him from Wanalah. After the fashion
of the time and country, these consisted of
a "pleated bosom" shirt, a damask silk vest,
a long tailed broadcloth coat, a pair of "doe-skin"
trousers, white socks with silken clocks,
and a pair of "low quarter" shoes with broad
silken ties. It was certain that before mounting
his horse again for the journey to Wanalah,
Boyd Westover would shed the shoes
at any rate and don his high-topped boots instead,
but for the present he felt a social obligation
upon him to dress conventionally; for
he had found at the hotel a note from Major
Magister, the leader of the bar, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Of course you'll dine with me at four
o'clock, Westover. The Judge will be present,
and I hope Jack Towns and the Commonwealth's
Attorney also, prepared to reconcile
the differences created by this trial, and become
friends again. But none of these is what I
mean when I say 'of course' you'll dine with
me. The 'of course' takes the much more
pleasing form of a charming young gentlewoman
from Boston,&mdash;Miss Millicent Danvers,&mdash;to
whom we all want to show every
possible attention, and especially to introduce
you as a typical young gentleman of Virginia.
She is with us only for the day. So don't send
any excuses, but come in your own proper person."
</p>

<p>
Remembering that Boyd Westover was a
gallant, hot-blooded young Virginian, and that
it had been many moons since he had enjoyed
association with young women of his class and
caste, it is easy to understand the eagerness
with which he welcomed this opportunity to
"get himself civilized again," as he framed
the thought in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"From Boston?" he reflected. "I suppose
she'll have gold-rimmed spectacles and talk
philosophy. I never met a Boston girl, so this
will be a new experience. After all, I suppose
women are very much alike, no matter where
they come from. Doubtless this one has pulses,
just as other girls have, and perhaps I shall be
able to put my finger on them. At any rate
it will interest me to try. My opportunities
promise to be good. Major Magister and the
Judge and Jack Towns and the Commonwealth's
Attorney are sure to fall foul of each
other over abstruse law points that the rest of
us know nothing about, and that will leave
mine hostess and the Boston maid to me."
</p>

<p>
It was in this mood of pleasurable but by
no means enthusiastic anticipation that Westover
entered the home of his host, half an
hour after the jury had returned a verdict of
"not guilty," in the case of Jack Towns's client&mdash;a
verdict that was based rather upon the
absence of evidence that Jack Towns had succeeded
in excluding than upon the evidence actually
presented at the trial.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="chap24"></a>
XXIV
<br />
A PERFECT WOMAN&mdash;AND A MAN
</h3>

<p>
When his hostess presented him to
Millicent Danvers, Westover could
scarcely believe that this was the
young woman he had been invited to meet. He
had constructed a portrait of her in his imagination
and she did not satisfy any of the details
of the picture. He had expected to find her
tall, bony, Roman-nosed, and sallow. She was
instead of moderate height, plump, with delicately
moulded Grecian features, and a complexion
of pink and white that had no suggestion
of sallowness in it. He had expected
spectacles; instead he found a pair of gray-blue
eyes that looked into his own with candor
and fearless trustfulness, like those of a child
of four or five years of age, and yet with the
confidence and courage that come only of good
breeding allied to perfect innocence. He had
prepared himself to meet an aggressive, self
assertive manner; instead he found all the shyness
of young girlhood, all the modesty of
maiden inexperience, allied with a frank, self-respecting
truthfulness that was fearless because
of its confidence of right intent.
</p>

<p>
They talked, of course, about the young
woman's impressions of Virginia.
</p>

<p>
"It is lovely," she said. "You know it is
all a surprise, an astonishment to me."
</p>

<p>
"How so? Would you mind explaining
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot exactly explain it. You see it's
like a pleasant dream. You know it made you
happy while you were dreaming it, and you
know it makes you happy after you're awake,
but you can't tell just what it was you dreamed
or just why it made you happy. It is so elusive
that you can't grasp it and put it into words.
I'm still dreaming Virginia, and I know I shall
never be able to tell anybody why the dream is
so delicious. I try to think it out sometimes,
but I can't. Whenever I make up my mind
that it is because of this thing or that, I say
'No, that isn't it.' I suppose it's a thousand
little things put together. But tell me about
this election of yours. I'm talking too much
about myself and my thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"No, you are not. The election doesn't interest
me, and what you've been saying does.
Go on, please. You had more in your mind."
</p>

<p>
"How can you know that?" she asked in
genuine surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Because you spoke of 'a thousand little
things.' I wish you would tell me about a
dozen of them, or even half a dozen."
</p>

<p>
With a world of childlike seriousness in her
wide open eyes the girl responded:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I ought not to have said a thousand.
That was an exaggeration, and exaggeration
is as bad as any other kind of fibbing,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"In some cases, yes&mdash;in some, no. Certainly
it was not so in this case. Your phrase
carried to my mind precisely the thought you
had in your own, and so it was perfectly truthful."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you think so. I try always to
tell the truth."
</p>

<p>
"So I should imagine. Now will you not
go on and tell me some of the things that please
you in our Virginia life? Is it so different
from your life up North? You see I have
never been North."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, so different! I think most of us
up North are good people, just as I suppose
most people are everywhere. But there's a difference&mdash;a
something, I don't know just
what. Yes, I do, too, in part at least, though
I'm not sure I can put it into words. We live
within ourselves, and you don't. We love our
friends and are kind to them, but we aren't
close to them, as people down here are. It is
because we are shy, I suppose. Our attitude
toward money values is different. I don't
know that our people care more about money
than you do, but&mdash;well, we take it into account
as you do not. But that isn't what I
mean. There is a certain graciousness in your
ways of living, a warmth, a color&mdash;I don't
know what to call it&mdash;that fascinates me.
We are scrupulously polite to each other; you
are cordially courteous instead. I suppose that
too is because we are shyer than you are. We
shrink from self revelation as you do not. I
think we are really as warm-hearted as you
Virginians are, but we are more reserved."
</p>

<p>
"You are doubtless right. I've observed
that temperamental peculiarity in the Northern
men I've met. At the University there was
a young man from Boston who became my
chum under rather peculiar circumstances, and
I studied him closely. Because of a certain
delicacy of constitution which rendered your
Boston winters dangerous to his health, he was
sent to the University of Virginia instead of
Harvard. He didn't know our ways, and as
a 'Yankee'&mdash;you know how unjustly that
word has come to have evil significance with
us&mdash;he was a good deal shunned, and things
were said, and&mdash;well, it so came about that
he and I became chums and occupied a room
together on the lawn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," she answered dreamily, as
if recalling a story. "But you are suppressing
the truth, Mr. Westover."
</p>

<p>
In an astonishment that well nigh made him
spring from his chair, he asked:
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Our hostess is rising," she replied with a
calm dignity that was fascinating to the young
man. "We ladies must leave you gentlemen
to your wine and cigars."
</p>

<p>
"I do not take wine," he replied, "and as
for cigars I shall gladly give them up in favor
of a further conversation with you. If you
permit, I will quit the table with you."
</p>

<p>
"There!" she exclaimed. "That's one of
the 'thousand' things I spoke of. In Virginia
you gentlemen manifest a certain deference
toward women that I have seen nowhere else.
It is gallantly protective, respectfully, not servilely
submissive, a tribute of strength to weakness
which carries with it no reflection upon
the weakness, and to women it is the most
fascinating thing imaginable. I've expressed
it lamely, but&mdash;" and with that she took a
handful of cigars from the passing box and
added:
</p>

<p>
"At any rate your courtesy to me shall
not cost you your smoke. We won't go
into the drawing room, but into the porch.
The day is mild, and I want to tell you that
story."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me first," he said as they passed into
the porch, "how you happen to know anything
about it."
</p>

<p>
"It is simple enough. I've heard my brother
tell the story with enthusiasm many, many
times."
</p>

<p>
"Your brother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Holmes Wentworth is my elder
brother. My mother was married twice, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"I see. I didn't know. If I had known&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you had known you wouldn't have
spoken of the matter at all. And as it was,
you were suppressing all the interesting facts.
Now I'm going to relate them according to
the gospel of Holmes Wentworth. In a debating
society one night he expressed some opinions
that gave offence to certain of the students,
and some proposal of censure was made
and hotly advocated. You opposed it, declaring
that debate without absolute free speech
must be a mockery. Your impassioned utterance
won approval, and the resolution was
voted down with only three or four men
voting for it. They were not Virginians
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They were the sons of negro traders, every
man of them," interrupted Westover; "and
for the negro trader and his belongings Virginia
gentlemen have neither recognition nor
tolerance. They are the vilest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused in search of a more effective
epithet, and she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I know all about that," she said, "and you
needn't bite an inch off your next cigar by
way of expressing yourself. Let me go on
with the story. Those 'lewd fellows of the
baser sort' went down into Charlottesville and
organized a crew of ruffians to drive Holmes
Wentworth out of the University and out of
Virginia. You heard of the thing, and arming
yourself with all the Colt's revolvers you
could borrow, you hurried into the town.
There you found Holmes sorely beset by a
dozen armed ruffians and a crowd of other
jeering dissolutes. You pushed him up into
a corner, thrust a pair of the pistols into his
hands, and took your place beside him, saying:
'If they rush us, shoot with both hands, and
<i>shoot to kill</i>; there's no good in wasting ammunition.'
Then you called out to the mob:
'Now do your worst, you cowards! But the
first man that crosses that curbstone dies the
death of the dog that he is, and we'll send
some others to&mdash;' really you used some dreadful
language, Mr. Westover, which I can't repeat,
though I know it all by heart. And a
little later, after the mob had quailed before
you, you swore worse than ever, ordering
them to disperse or you'd fire into them and
send some of them to the place you had already
mentioned. Oh, it was glorious! But the
sheriff came and drove the crowd away. You
see I know the whole story. Do you wonder
that I find things to like in Virginia? Then
you took Holmes to live in the same room
with you, and after you learned to understand
him as well as he already understood you, he
and you became bosom friends."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he replied, throwing away a
cigar that he had forgotten to light; "but
really Holmes's imagination is creative and he
has made too much of a trifle."
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't any imagination at all," she replied;
"he's the most prosaic, literal, realistic
fact mongerer imaginable, as you very well
know. But now I'm going to turn woman
again and talk about myself."
</p>

<p>
Westover thought that about the most tactful
turning of a conversation that he had ever
known. But she gave him no time to wonder
over it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm staying at The Oaks, you know, with
Margaret Conway. She's the very sweetest,
truest, loveliest girl I ever knew. She's fit to
be the wife of the noblest man in Virginia."
</p>

<p>
Westover winced, and the girl observed the
fact without recognizing it in any way. Instead
she went on:
</p>

<p>
"You see she was my guest for six weeks
a year ago, and I'm returning her visit and
incidentally enjoying life better than I ever
dreamed that one could do. By the way,
there's to be a dance at Dr. Carver's over at
Fighting Creek, wherever that is, to-morrow
night&mdash;no, it's the next night, and as there is
to be some sort of public meeting near there
that day, I suppose I shall see you at the
party."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a double irruption
from the dining room on the one side
and the drawing room on the other, into the
porch to see an autumn sunset of peculiar gorgeousness.
A little later Boyd Westover took
his leave, and bidding Jack Towns follow at
his convenience, set out for Wanalah.
</p>

<p>
As he went he found himself thinking of
Millicent Danvers with far more admiration
and greatly tenderer sentiment than he had believed
himself capable of feeling toward any
woman since Margaret had been lost to him.
</p>

<p>
"She is certainly charming," he said to himself;
then correcting his thought he said, "No,
that is not the word; it is commonplace, conventional,
cheap, and nothing commonplace,
conventional or cheap can describe Millicent
Danvers. She is all woman&mdash;that's it, and
I can't imagine anything better as belonging
to this world or the next. She is honest, truthful,
genuine, but those are ordinary virtues,
and her virtues are not confined to the ordinary.
She is sympathetic with all things that
are essentially right and of good report. Still,
that is not the secret of her charm, for many
women&mdash;perhaps most women&mdash;are all that.
She has high ideals and she is loyal to them.
She's the sort of woman Jephtha's daughter is
supposed to have been, and at the same time
she has all the qualities that make the story
of Ruth the greatest masterpiece of all literature.
Heroism is hers, and gentleness not less.
She is a Joan of Arc and she is the most trusting
child that was ever gently dandled on one's
knee. I have it! She has faith; she believes;
she trusts, and in her belief she dares and honors
daring. Heroism is to her an object of
worship; devotion a divine inspiration; truth
an inborn characteristic. It is just as I said
before&mdash;she is all woman, and in all God's
work he created nothing else so good or so
great as that."
</p>

<p>
As he reached this point in his meditations
he was passing the outer gates of The Oaks
plantation, and suddenly his thought reverted
to Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"She, too, is a woman of that type," he reflected.
"I do not understand her silence, but
I should be unworthy of any woman's love if
I doubted her truth. I will not doubt her. I
will let no other take her place in my heart so
long as I live. She is all that Millicent Danvers
is, and to me she is more and always
must be. She is the woman who gave me
love for love, and even in an estrangement that
can now never be undone, I cannot forget the
troth we plighted before Fate interposed to
spoil my life. I shall not attend the dance at
Dr. Carver's."

<br />
THE GREAT RENUNCIATION
</h3>

<p>
The drizzling rain that had marred the
day had ceased during the afternoon.
The late October sun had set in a
golden glory while yet Westover lingered by
the side of Millicent Danvers in the porch of
the Magister homestead. The evening that
followed was irresistibly tempting to lovers of
the out of doors.
</p>

<p>
Two men sat in converse in the porch at
Wanalah.
</p>

<p>
Two women sat in converse in the porch at
The Oaks.
</p>

<p>
The two men were Boyd Westover and Jack
Towns.
</p>

<p>
The two women were Margaret Conway and
Millicent Danvers.
</p>

<p>
The conversations in the two porches were
utterly unlike in substance, in tone and in effect.
Nevertheless they were not unrelated&mdash;in
part at least.
</p>

<p>
Jack Towns had come to give an account of
his stewardship, but Westover, with his habitual
indifference to petty details, insisted upon
it that the report should be broadly general.
</p>

<p>
"When a man has arranged a matter," he
said, "involving nine seven times over, I like
him to say sixty-three at the outset, instead of
seven times nine. I hate to multiply and divide
and add and subtract."
</p>

<p>
"Why the deuce are you doing it, then?"
demanded Jack.
</p>

<p>
"As how?"
</p>

<p>
"Why by making the wholly needless and
utterly idle computation that seven times nine
is sixty-three. Why didn't you just say you
liked totals rather than the factors producing
them?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is because I never studied law
and therefore haven't a well ordered mind."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't suppose anything of the sort.
I suppose it's because your mind is fascinated
with some other subject&mdash;and by the way she
really is charming&mdash;so that it wearies you to
think of anything else. Perhaps you'll feel
otherwise when you hear what I have to tell
you. Are you ready to listen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, certainly. Go on."
</p>

<p>
"Very well then. That father of yours was
never so wise in all his life as when he bought
all that mining land up in the Rocky Mountains.
I don't know and I can't even guess
how he found out the value of what he was
buying."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he didn't," said Boyd. "May be
he was simply coppering on the ace and taking
the chances."
</p>

<p>
"I had thought of that. It's the most probable
solution. However that may be, he managed
to buy Golconda and Ophir and California
and Australia and the mint and the assay
office all in one when he disbursed a few thousand
dollars for about the most desolate spot
on earth, a place where you not only can't raise
a potato but can't even boil one because of the
altitude. It takes half an hour up there to produce
a soft-boiled egg. You can boil water in
two minutes, and as it boils it is so cool you
can bathe in it half a minute later. I have
some counterfeit continental currency in a cabinet
at my house, and upon my word, if anybody
had offered me all the land your father
bought for you up there in exchange for one
of those old and doubly discredited shin-plasters,
I wouldn't have made the trade."
</p>

<p>
"Then the whole thing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the kind. I didn't say that or
suggest it. I've put your land and mining
rights into a new company that already has
machinery and management and technical
skill and brains established there. The stock
of that company will pay heaven only knows
how many hundred per cent. per annum in the
way of dividends, and thirty-nine per cent. of
it is yours. By way of boot, as horse traders
call it, I brought away nine hundred and fifty
thousand dollars in sight drafts on New York
and Boston. I tried hard to force them to
make it a million just for the name of the
thing, but I couldn't because they are men of
affairs with no sense of the picturesque. And
after all&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What on earth am I to do with all that
money?" asked Boyd in a tone of distressed
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll manage that easily enough after
you get used to having it. And if you don't
want to bother yourself about it, you needn't.
I've already invested it for you, acting under
my blanket power of attorney, so that
the interest is all you'll have to look out
for."
</p>

<p>
"What have you done with it, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"In view of the disturbed condition of politics
in this country and the rumors of possible
war, I have had something more than half of
it sent to the Barings in London to be invested
in British consols and French rentes. The rest
is invested in Virginia sixes and other good,
interest paying bonds, and is in the vaults of
August Belmont &amp; Co. in New York. By way
of providing you with pocket money, I've
placed twenty-five thousand dollars to your
credit in the Farmers' Bank of Virginia.
There. There isn't a seven times nine problem
in that whole story for you to wrestle with.
You've got only your sixty-three to consider,
and when you grow quite sane again you can
go over the detailed statements that I shall
leave with you. Now tell me, what does it
mean&mdash;Colonel Conway's attitude I refer to
of course."
</p>

<p>
"Frankly, I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all you do know, and perhaps I
can figure out the rest. You see it doesn't
appall me to have a seven to multiply by a
nine."
</p>

<p>
"As I said before, I don't know. Colonel
Conway's attitude is a puzzle to me. Either
he thinks I've done something to offend, or he
doesn't. If he thinks so, it isn't conceivable
that he should sulk. It is his habit in such
cases to make an open issue of the matter.
He's a fighter, you know, and not a moody,
secretive hater. If he doesn't think I have
done anything that should offend him, I cannot
understand why he does not call upon me, and
especially I don't understand why he avoided
meeting me by staying away from the Court
House to-day, where I happen to know he had
important business. I shall challenge his attitude
pretty soon and force some sort of explanation."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and by way of preparation for that,
you are falling in love with the girl from Boston.
That will complicate matters charmingly.
Really, Boyd, for a man of brains, education,
culture and all that, you now and then make
the most elaborately embroidered idiot of yourself
I ever knew."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not in love with Miss Danvers;
I never saw her until to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand that. Nevertheless
after you have met her three or four times
more, you'll make the mistake of thinking
yourself in love with her, and you'll court her
and she will accept you&mdash;for she's positively
daffy about you, as I easily found out after you
left this evening. Then you'll awake to the
fact that after all a man's affections are not
so easily transferred as shares of stock are.
You've never told me so, but I know, nevertheless,
that the one love of your life is for
Margaret Conway, and if you permit yourself
to attempt a transfer of that passion, you'll
repent it in sackcloth and ashes so long as you
live. No, don't interrupt me. I'm in desperate
earnest, and I'm going to say my say out,
even if it results in your ordering my horse and
bidding me be gone from Wanalah forever.
Now listen to me. I once had a case of quarrelling
heirs to deal with. If they had been
left to their own devices, the whole estate they
were fighting for would have been dissipated
in chancery proceedings. I went to each of
them separately and compelled each to tell me
his side of the story. I found that the whole
trouble lay in a lot of mutual misunderstandings,
as most quarrels do. I multiplied seven
by nine and found it made sixty-three, and
after a little I got all of them to accept sixty-three
as the product of the factors. In other
words, I settled the whole affair, merely by
finding out both sides of the facts.
</p>

<p>
"Now in this case of yours, I am satisfied
that the entire trouble arises from a mutual
misunderstanding. I insist that you shall tell
me all the facts as you understand them. I
shall find means of discovering just what the
facts are as the other side understands them.
It is impertinent in an extreme degree for me
to inquire into the matter at all. But in the
practice of the law it is my function and duty
to be impertinent. Go on, then, and tell me the
facts as you understand them."
</p>

<p>
When Jack began his speech, Westover
foresaw what was coming, and was resentfully
determined to permit no trespass of such sort
upon his privacy. But before Jack had finished,
the old dream of life and love, with
Margaret for its saint and sovereign, had revived
in his mind. What if, after all, Jack
Towns should be able to unravel the mystery
of Margaret's silence and open a way for him?
In that moment all the love he had cherished
for Margaret surged back upon his soul in an
overwhelming flood that made all other women
objects of courteous but complete indifference.
He saw clearly that no woman on earth could
ever take the place in his heart that this one
woman had made her own. He could not even
conjecture how the result could be brought
about, but the very dream of it so far fascinated
him that he was ready to put aside all reserve
and respond in perfect candor to Jack Towns's
impertinence.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know how to tell the story, Jack,"
he responded, "but I'll tell it somehow, if
you'll give me time. Margaret and I were
brought up together. Never mind that; it is
unimportant. The time came when I loved her
and she loved me, and we told each other so.
With her father's enthusiastic consent we became
engaged, and it was planned that the
marriage should take place during the late
summer&mdash;as soon as I should get the affairs
of Wanalah adjusted. With that in view I
went to Richmond. You know what happened
there. I wrote to Margaret many times. I
got no word of reply. I hoped for her sympathy;
I had silence instead. I expected Colonel
Conway to come to my side during my trouble,
and to lend me at least the encouragement of
belief in me. He neither came nor sent a line
of sympathy in support of my courage. Even
the death of my mother&mdash;the cruellest blow
that fate had ever dealt me&mdash;brought no word
or line from him or from Margaret. When
my name was cleared of stigma by the confession
of the real culprit, I came back here to
Wanalah with the avowed purpose of making
necessary preparations for my sojourn in the
mountains. In point of fact, as I know now&mdash;my
purpose was to open the way for some communication
between Wanalah and The Oaks.
No such communication came. Colonel Conway
did not call upon me, and Margaret sent
me no line. Since then Colonel Conway has
emphasized his disapproval of me in other
ways, as you are aware."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well? You believe yourself possessed
of ordinary common sense, I suppose?" asked
Jack Towns in the tone he was in the habit of
using when cross examining a witness whom
he intended to discomfit.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Are you acquainted with Margaret Conway?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course you know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing. I'm trying to find out.
Answer the question. Are you acquainted
with Margaret Conway?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. I've known her ever since she was
born."
</p>

<p>
"Is she the sort of woman who would or
could do what she appears to have done in
this case? Is it conceivable that she has left
you in a crisis like that which you have gone
through, without a word of reply to letters received
from you? Is it probable? Is it even
possible? Is it thinkable?"
</p>

<p>
"Apparently&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang 'apparently.' Apparently the
sun circles round the earth, but we know better.
Apparently the moon is made of green cheese,
but it isn't. Apparently you are a crass idiot,
but in the ultimate analysis you are nothing of
the kind. Now answer my question: Is it
probable or even conceivably possible that under
the circumstances of your trouble in Richmond,
Margaret Conway, pledged as she was
to be your wife, and possessed as she is of an
exalted conception of womanly truth and
honor, and saturated as she is with the courage
of a proud race, the courage that does duty
and dares consequences&mdash;is it conceivably
possible that she has under such circumstances
sat still and left unanswered letters received
from you in your travail?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems unaccountable&mdash;" began Boyd,
and his companion interrupted him:
</p>

<p>
"Nobody has asked you to account for that
which could not have happened. I am asking
you to search your own soul and say whether
or not this thing can be true. If anybody
should tell me that Boyd Westover had set up
a counterfeiting plant in one of his barns and
was busily 'shoving the queer,' would you expect
me to go bothering about how such a thing
could have come about? Would you not expect
rather that I should give the story the lie
without further ado? This is a like case. If
you know Margaret Conway, you know she
has not been guilty of this stupendous wrong.
You have no right to go on acting as if she
had been."
</p>

<p>
"You are right of course," Boyd replied,
"so far at least as the principle is concerned.
But how do you account for the facts?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't my business to account for the
facts. I know and you know that under the
circumstances which arose in this case, Margaret
Conway <i>did not leave unanswered any
letter she received from you</i>. Either she did
not receive your letters, or you did not receive
her replies, or, more probably, both things
happened."
</p>

<p>
"But how could that be? I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know. I'm not the proper person
to ask. I'm going up to bed now, if you don't
mind. I've said all I had in mind to say."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The conversation in the other porch was
not like this, and yet in its way it was not
unlike it.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you enjoyed yourself at the Magisters'
to-day, Millicent," said Margaret as the
two seated themselves in the porch. "I'm
sorry I couldn't be with you, but you see old
Judy was very low, and I really had to stay
with her."
</p>

<p>
"Of course. Only it's all an astonishment
to me&mdash;I mean the way in which you look
after negroes who are ill."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course we must do that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I understand now, but I didn't. I
thought you treated them as so many cattle.
Of course I knew you looked after your own
maids and other personal serving women, but
I thought field negroes&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know, dear. The whole system, is bad
and I wish we were rid of it. But people up
North always imagine that its worst possibilities
are the daily facts, and we naturally resent
that. We aren't angels by any means, but at
least we are human beings. Never mind that
now. Tell me about the dinner and the company."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't see much of the company.
The Judge and Mr. Towns, and the Judge's
wife and the Commonwealth's Attorney talked
hotly about law things that I didn't at all understand,
so I talked mainly with Mr. Boyd
Westover. Margaret, I'd like to spend my
whole life listening to him talk. You see he's
so big and strong, and yet so gentle and chivalric.
He makes you feel that you ought to
think yourself worth while, because he respects
you so, and is so deferential to you. Why,
even my poor little thinkings seemed to me of
some account because of the way in which he
listened to me and treated my utterances. I
tell you, Margaret, he is the most perfect type
of the gentleman I ever saw or dreamed of."
</p>

<p>
The night was starlit, but there was no
moon as yet, for it was far past the full, and
the porch was dark. Margaret Conway was
grateful for the shadow. It hid her countenance
and prevented self-revelation of a kind
that must have filled her soul with humiliation
and shame. It gave her time in which to recover
her self-control. Presently she forced
herself to say:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Westover is certainly a good example
of our best type of gentleman. You'll like him
more as you become better acquainted with
him, and fortunately you'll meet him again almost
immediately. He's sure to be at the dance
at Dr. Carver's over at Fighting Creek."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's to speak over there. Oh, Margaret,
I wonder if I might hear his speech?
Do they let women attend? You see he is so
big and brave and manly and <i>so</i> handsome.
He's sure to make a speech worth listening
to. Do you think I might get a chance to
hear it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear, certainly," responded Margaret
in a voice that in spite of her had something
of hardness in it. "I will arrange that. You'll
sit in a carriage on the outskirts of the crowd,
and you can hear every word, unless&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Unless what, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was only thinking out loud. You
see your carriage will be surrounded by half
a dozen young men, all in love with you, all
madly jealous, and all eager to win and hold
your attention. If you can suppress them,
you'll hear the whole speech."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Margaret, have you known him
a long time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all my life."
</p>

<p>
"I see," she answered. What she had in
her mind was that the intimacy between these
two was perhaps too close and too familiar to
permit a softer feeling to grow up between
them. "Otherwise," she reflected, "they
would have been lovers of course. How could
either of them help that?"
</p>

<p>
But she gave no utterance to the thought.
She only subconsciously rejoiced that matters
were as she supposed them to be.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I can be with you over at
Fighting Creek, Millicent," said Margaret
after she had mastered herself and formed a
plan.
</p>

<p>
"But why not? I shall not go if you can't,"
answered the girl with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, you will. I wish you to be there.
You'll meet everybody in this whole region
who is worth meeting. I wouldn't have you
miss that on any account. Besides, I should
get up a very unlovely reputation for selfishness,
if I suffered you to miss such a festivity
merely because I can't enjoy it with
you."
</p>

<p>
"But why can't you, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"There are several reasons. For one thing
my father is laid up with an attack of the gout,
you know. That's why he turned back after
he had started to Court to-day. He doesn't
seem to be suffering much, but gout is treacherous,
and I must be within call of him. Then
again there are two or three cases of fever at
the far quarters."
</p>

<p>
Then, as if fearing to have the sufficiency of
her excuses too closely questioned, she hurriedly
added:
</p>

<p>
"I've planned it all beautifully, Millicent.
I'll send you over to Fighting Creek in The
Oaks carriage. My maid shall go with you
as escort, and I'll send for Carter Barksdale to
go on horseback as your gallant outrider. You
see Carter is only seventeen years of age, and
he reads Byron and Shelley and Scott till he's
saturated with romance. He's perfectly charming,
and you'll enjoy his escort all the more
because he's just old enough to fall madly in
love with you at first sight, and just young
enough to be afraid to tell you so. He's a
Virginia type that I want you to meet. That
sort of boy is at his best when he's seventeen
and takes himself so seriously that he shrinks
from the open declaration of the fancies he
mistakes for passions. He will revel in a
silent, unspoken, unrequited love for one as
far removed from his approach as the northern
star, 'of whose true, fixed, and resting quality'
he will quote, 'there is no fellow in the firmament.'
Of course, after he has thoroughly enjoyed
the unspeakable wretchedness of a
blighted passion, he will fall in love with the
next young woman several years older than
himself who comes in his way, and have the
romance all over again."
</p>

<p>
"Margaret," said Millicent seriously and
tenderly, "you are not happy to-night. You
are cynical. Something has disturbed you.
Don't you feel that you can tell me what it
is and let me share your sorrow as freely as
you let me share your more joyful moods?"
</p>

<p>
Margaret Conway was too inherently truthful
to protest that she had no cause of unhappiness
when she had. But, with an instinctive
flinching from self-revelation, which every sensitive
soul experiences at such a time, she carefully
framed her speech for purposes of avoidance.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I'm cynical, Millicent. I
don't feel so. I meant only to be amusing in
talking of something that always amuses me.
It has always seemed to me funny that young
men should be so desperately afraid of us
young women even when we are trembling in
holy awe of them. I've seen so much of that
sort of thing. Sometimes it becomes tragical
and spoils lives that do not deserve to be
spoiled. I knew one case in which it was saved
from doing that only by the impertinent interference
of a very peculiar young woman."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's a story," exclaimed Millicent,
"and a love story at that. Tell it please."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't much of a story, but I'll tell it.
I had a governess whom I loved dearly and
with reason. She taught me all I know,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She must have been a woman of wonderful
acquirements then."
</p>

<p>
"She was and is, but such culture as I possess
is not an adequate indication of her learning
or of her capacity to teach. I owe her all
I ever learned; I owe to my own indifference
all the defects in my education."
</p>

<p>
There was something in Margaret's tone as
she said this, that attracted Millicent's attention.
</p>

<p>
"She is certainly cynical, self-accusative, unsatisfied,"
she reflected. "She isn't happy,
and it behooves you, Millicent Danvers, to find
out the cause and remedy the condition if you
can."
</p>

<p>
Without uttering that thought, she said:
</p>

<p>
"You aren't telling me the love story, Margaret,
and I'm eager to hear that before I let
Carter Barksdale fall in love with me. You
see I'm young and wholly inexperienced, and
I naturally want to learn how such things are
conducted."
</p>

<p>
Margaret laughed lowly, as she thought:
"A girl like you doesn't need lessons in the
conduct of love affairs. To such as you,
love,&mdash;like 'to write and read, comes by nature.'"
</p>

<p>
Then she resumed her story:
</p>

<p>
"Apart from her learning, Miss Jane was
an altogether admirable woman, and very naturally
our neighbor, Mr. Skipwith, fell in love
with her. He came over here to see her every
day for more than a year. He sent her flowers
from his garden, and when the frosts put an
end to that he built a green house, in order
that he might keep on sending her flowers.
But somehow he never could get up courage
enough to ask for her hand, until one day
Harriet Middleton brought about a crisis.
Harriet was an English girl of peculiarly good
family whose father had migrated to Virginia
in search of health. Harriet was almost an
old maid, though not quite. She was blunt
and aggressive in manner, though as gentle
and good as anybody could be when you came
really to know her. She was quick and shrewd
of observation, and it did not take her long to
find out how matters stood between Mr. Skipwith
and Miss Jane. But the days and weeks
went on and still there were no results. One
evening when the moon shone dreamily
through a soft haze, Mr. Skipwith and Miss
Jane sat here in the porch, while Harriet and
I walked away through the orchard, by way
of leaving them alone, and picking up some
good apples. When we returned, the pair were
sitting precisely as we had left them, at a respectful
distance from each other, and both
their attitude and their manner bore convincing
witness that even the hazy moonlight had failed
to bring about a crisis.
</p>

<p>
"Harriet's patience gave way. She stalked
into the porch, with that horse-like tread that
Englishwomen use for a walk, and, taking her
stand between the two, said:
</p>

<p>
"'You two people love each other. You
want to tell each other about it but you don't
dare; so I'm telling you instead. Now that
I've introduced the subject, perhaps you'll talk
it out.'
</p>

<p>
"With that she passed on into the house,
and a few weeks later Mr. Skipwith and Miss
Jane were married."
</p>

<p>
"And have they lived happily ever afterwards?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed they have. They are well to do
and very hospitable, and a pleasanter place
to visit than the Skipwith plantation doesn't
exist in Virginia."
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Middleton?"
</p>

<p>
"She's enjoying herself, bossing an insane
asylum. She's only a patient there, but she
believes she's the superintendent, and they let
her give all the orders she thinks fit. Matilda,"
addressing a maid who at that moment appeared
with some lemonade, "send for the
carriage please, and send word that I want old
Michael to drive me. Johnny is apt to go to
sleep."
</p>

<p>
"But where on earth are you going to drive
at eleven o'clock at night?" asked Millicent
in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you know I have some fever patients
out at the far quarters."
</p>

<p>
She was at pains not to say that she was
going to visit them, though she half intended
to do so. Her desire&mdash;imperative and passionate&mdash;was
to separate herself from human
companionship and think out the problems
that beset her soul.
</p>

<p>
"But mayn't I go with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no. You might get the fever, and
besides, you must get your beauty sleep. After
you are married to&mdash;to some Virginia gentleman,
and become the mistress of a plantation,
you will of course look after your sick servants.
Just now it is your duty to go to bed. There's
an old novel 'Dunallan' on the dressing case
in my room. Go in there and get it. It's the
very sleepiest thing I ever saw in my life.
Read half a dozen pages of it and you'll be
sound asleep. Good night. I won't speak to
you when I come back, lest I disturb your
slumbers. Oh, by the way, tell Diana to put
three candles on my candle stand and place
it close to my bed. And tell her please to go
to bed as soon as she gets things ready in our
rooms. I shall not want her to-night, and she
has had a hard day."
</p>

<p>
As she finished speaking the carriage drove
up, with the white-haired old coachman
Michael on the box. He had long ago ceased
to have active duties of any kind to do, but
when his "young missus" asked for him to
drive her anywhere, at any time and under any
circumstances, the loyal old servitor was ready
and eager in response. He had driven Margaret's
mother on her wedding journey to the
mountain resorts. He had driven Margaret
herself to her christening. He had grown old
but never lax in the service, and now in his
old age, when he was excused from all service,
it was his chief joy to drive his "young
missus" whenever she honored him by asking
that he should do so.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion he saw clearly enough that
Margaret was distraught, and when she entered
the carriage he forbore to distress her
with questions. He simply picked out the best
roads and followed them. After awhile she
spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you'd better drive to the far quarters,
Uncle Michael. I ought to see the sick
ones."
</p>

<p>
"Dey ain't sick, Miss Margaret. Leastways
dey ain't sick enough for you to go botherin'
'bout 'em. Dey's jes' a sufferin' dere own
calamities. Dey stole a shoat night before last
an' gorged on it all night. 'Course dey had a
fever yestiddy an' to-day. Don't you go a
botherin' 'bout dem no 'count niggas, Miss
Margaret. Jes' you let ole Michael pick out
de roads fer you and drive you 'bout, comfortable
like."
</p>

<p>
With this reassuring release from obligation,
the girl sank back among the cushions
as the late rising, gibbous moon came up
from the horizon, and abandoned herself to
thought.
</p>

<p>
She was a woman, young, strong, passionate;
she cherished still that dream of love
which had so recently inspired and illumined
her life. She could not understand why or
how it had been snatched away by circumstance.
It was hard for her to believe that
all she had hoped for and held dear had been
banished from her life by a final, arbitrary, inexplicable
decree of fate.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," she reflected, "it is so. Between
Boyd and me there is a great gulf
fixed, and nothing can furnish a bridge across
it."
</p>

<p>
Then another thought occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I should write to Boyd and ask
him for an explanation?
</p>

<p>
"No, I could not do that without sacrificing
that pride of womanhood without which a
woman is nothing and worse than nothing.
No, that can never be. I wonder why he does
not himself offer an explanation and seek a
restoration of old relations? No, that can
never be. It would involve such a sacrifice of
manhood as is inconceivable. There is never
any explanation possible, never any solution to
this riddle, never anything."
</p>

<p>
She sat still for awhile, not thinking at all.
Suddenly she reflected:
</p>

<p>
"After all it is his happiness that I care for.
My own is of no consequence. He is a man,
and it will be easy for him to transfer his affections.
Men are not like women in that
way. Millicent will make a fitter wife for him
than I ever could. He will be happy with her,
and as for me&mdash;well, it doesn't matter. I
have my duties and my occupations. The rest
is of no consequence. He shall love Millicent
and marry her, and may be, when I'm an old,
old woman, he and I will come to understand
each other again, at least so far that neither
shall accuse the other of treachery."
</p>

<p>
With a mind attuned to the great renunciation,
she called to Michael and bade him drive
back to The Oaks.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="chap26"></a>
XXVI
<br />
MOONLIGHT RESOLUTIONS
</h3>

<p>
Millicent Danvers was a
frank, open-minded young woman,
almost childlike in her simplicity of
soul in every case where candor was met with
equal candor. But her childlikeness included
a child's subtle instinct as to the moods and
motives of others, and where affection
prompted her scrutiny she was not often at
fault in her judgments of human conduct.
</p>

<p>
When Margaret, refusing her company,
drove away that night Millicent knew perfectly
that her friend's spirit was disturbed in
some unusual way, for until then these two
had been comrades in every such expedition,
and Margaret had been the one most insistent
that they should be so.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to see every phase of our
Virginia life," she had many times said, "so
that when you go back to Boston you may
know what there is in it to approve, what to
admire, what to condemn, and what merely to
laugh at. For I'm sure there is much in it
that must strike Northern people as ludicrous.
Anyhow I want you to see it all and understand
all of it. Then I'm not afraid to trust
our life and our ways and our impulses to your
hands for explanation and exposition to people
who are ignorant of them or know them only
by prejudiced hearsay."
</p>

<p>
The events of this day, and especially Margaret's
own conduct had been so different from
all this as to awaken curiosity and compel attention.
Both the curiosity and the attention
had a deep and sincere affection for their
prompting.
</p>

<p>
When Margaret drove away and the late
rising, gibbous moon appeared above the tree
tops and shone softly through the windows of
Millicent's southeast room, the girl sat down
there by a casement to wonder, to conjecture,
to "guess," and, better still, to "think this
thing out to the end."
</p>

<p>
"There is something wrong with Margaret,"
was her first thought. "She is disturbed
and distressed, and she isn't the kind
of person to be disturbed and distressed without
adequate reason. Why didn't she go over
to the Court House with me this morning and
dine at the Magisters'? She intended to do
so. She and I had planned it all out, and she
had accepted Mrs. Magister's invitation. It
was only at the last moment that she decided
to stay and nurse her father's purely mythical
gout. It was only five minutes before that
that a note had come from Mrs. Magister,
saying that Mr. Boyd Westover had come
down out of the mountains and that she
should 'compel' him to be one of her dinner
guests. I wonder if that news brought on the
attack of gout, and decided Margaret to stay
at the Oaks and nurse it?
</p>

<p>
"Then again it is clear that Margaret does
not expect Mr. Westover to visit her in the
near future. I wonder why? His plantation
adjoins this, and everybody says the two
families have been intimate for generations.
There must be some special reason. In fact
there is. Somebody told me to-day that Colonel
Conway had refused to join in the nomination
of Mr. Westover, and that the fact is
injuring Mr. Westover's canvass. I wonder
what it means? Naturally Mr. Westover and
Margaret should be sweethearts, and after a
while they should marry each other. I wonder
why things haven't gone that way? May
be they have been too intimate in their childhood.
No, that isn't the solution. It doesn't
explain Margaret's care to avoid Mr. Westover.
It doesn't explain her plan to send me
to Fighting Creek without her. It doesn't
explain her drive to-night. It doesn't explain
anything. If they were mere intimates, too
intimate to think of love, Mr. Westover would
be a frequent guest at The Oaks and the relations
of the two would be comradely."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a while in the formulation
of her thinking into orderly phrases. Then
she reflected:
</p>

<p>
"When I mentioned Margaret to him at
dinner to-day he distinctly winced. Every
time I have mentioned him to her to-night,
she has turned the conversation to other subjects."
</p>

<p>
There was another long pause in the formulation
of her thought. At last her common
sense asserted itself and she said to herself:
</p>

<p>
"Millicent Danvers, you are treading upon
dangerous ground, and you must get off it as
quickly as possible. There has been a love affair
between Margaret and Westover. You
can't shut your eyes to that fact or pretend not
to see it. Some break has come, but such
breaks may be repaired, and it is your function
to repair this one."
</p>

<p>
A wave of melancholy swept over her soul
as she thought of this. She mightily admired
Boyd Westover, and she had even dreamed
a little dream with regard to him. She was
a proud maiden in her way and as she searched
her heart there in the moonlight, she decided
that she had not suffered herself to fall in love
with Westover.
</p>

<p>
"How could I?" she challenged herself to
answer. "I have met him but once. The
thing is absurd. Besides, no self-respecting
young woman gives her love to any man until
he asks for it. No, of course I'm not in love
with Mr. Westover. It is nothing but admiration
that I feel for him."
</p>

<p>
Then, as she looked out into the tree-studded
house grounds, where all nature seemed to
sleep in the soft haze of the moonlight, she
added to her thought:
</p>

<p>
"But it would be easy for such a man to
change a woman's admiration into love by a
phrase, a word, a look into her eyes. Thank
God he has not yet looked into my eyes in that
way, and, God being my helper, he never shall.
After all,&mdash;well, after all there are only a few
men in the world that&mdash;well, anyhow, it isn't
so terrible a thing to be an old maid, and I'll
do my duty in this case if the stars start from
their courses, as a consequence." Then she
laughed under her breath, and jeered in
mocking fashion at the absurdity of her
thought:
</p>

<p>
"Of course the stars will do nothing of the
kind. That was a bit of heroics, and I'm not
a heroine of romance. I'm only a simple, honest,
Boston girl. I love Margaret dearly, and
I'm resolved to do all I can to bring about a
reconciliation between her and Mr. Westover,
for I'm satisfied there is need for something
of the sort. That's sane and sensible at any
rate, and the stars have nothing to do with
it."
</p>

<p>
She had been reading an essay entitled,
"The Great Renunciation," and she was full
of its spirit, almost a devotee to the impulses it
sought to inspire. But as she recalled it she
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That had to do with the great religions
of the world. It didn't refer to the case of a
sensible girl who finds herself particularly attracted
by a young man at a first meeting and
decides that she will not let him fall in love
with her because she realizes that the best loved
friend of her life is, or has been or ought to
be his affianced wife. Millicent, I'm ashamed
of you. After all the instruction you've had as
to the conduct of life and the behavior of young
women, this thing is ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless there was sadness in that inexperienced
heart of hers, as she saw the carriage
reënter the house grounds, and herself hastened
to bed lest her friend should discover
her vigil. But if hers had not been the great
renunciation, at least it had been a resolution
of loyalty and good faith, and perhaps in the
eyes of the angels the two things are very
nearly the same. Her exacting New England
conscience at any rate was satisfied, so that it
let her sleep, just as Margaret's Virginia conscience&mdash;different
in kind but equally exigent
in its demands&mdash;permitted slumber, sweet and
refreshing, to come to her.
</p>

<p>
When the morning came these two met,
each intently resolved to render to the other
the supreme service of sacrifice, and neither
dreaming of the other's thought. But in all
human affairs circumstance has its part to play,
and while it cannot alter purposes it often plays
havoc with results. It was so in this case.
Things happened, and the happening was more
decisive than the moonlight meditations of a
pair of maidens could possibly be.
</p>

XXVII
<br />
THE PHILOSOPHY OF JACK TOWNS
</h3>

<p>
Boyd Westover had the excellent
mental habit of attending carefully to
more than one thing at a time.
</p>

<p>
Just now he had the election on his hands,
and with it some problems of personal dignity
and repute that required his closest attention.
But he also had Wanalah plantation to look
after, and in view of his long absence he felt
that home affairs were pressing.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly he was up before the dawn, on
the morning after his arrival, and for half an
hour after dawn he waited, not at all patiently,
for the coming of his overseer, to whom he had
sent a summons over night to be with him "at
the crack of day." Then instead of waiting
longer, he mounted his horse and rode away
on a tour of inspection.
</p>

<p>
It was well after sunrise when he returned
to find the overseer hitching his horse to the
rack.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Mr. Wilkinson," he said;
"I had hoped to see you this morning."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, sir, but Î was very tired last
night."
</p>

<p>
"So was I. I had walked all through the
night before. Never mind that now. I wanted
to see you at dawn. The sun is now half an
hour high. That means that you have wasted
an hour and a half of my time, and my time
is just now precious."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother to apologize. I can't waste
any further time listening to excuses. Why
are you seeding the Gaston field in wheat? I
directed otherwise, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, the fall has given us good
weather, and we can get in that two hundred
acres as well as not."
</p>

<p>
"But how about harvesting it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll manage that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, by making the negroes work by
moonlight, as you did last summer to the everlasting
shame of Wanalah plantation, and just
as you made too many hogsheads of tobacco
and too many barrels of corn to the hand. I
have told you before and I tell you now that
I will not have the hands over-worked. Is the
Gaston field seeded?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir. We begin on that to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Don't seed it. Let it lie fallow."
</p>

<p>
"But my gracious, Mr. Westover,&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about your gracious. I tell
you not to seed that field. And another thing:
You planted seven hundred thousand hills of
tobacco last year. I want you to write it up
in your hat that four hundred thousand is
Wanalah's limit. I want you to understand
that this plantation is not run for money. If
it supports itself, giving a decent living to the
whites and blacks on it, I shall be satisfied. If
it doesn't quite do that, I'll find a way in which
to make up the deficiency. Now I want you
to give all the negroes on the plantation a
whole holiday to-morrow. I understand
there's to be a big picnic with all-day preaching
over at Mount Moriah church, and I want
everybody on the plantation to attend it. By
the way, Bob!" calling to a passing negro,
"go at once and tell old Joe I want him to
kill two sheep&mdash;good fat ones&mdash;three shoats
and four turkeys this morning; tell him to
hang 'em in the ice house as soon as they're
dressed, and send them over to Mount
Moriah early to-morrow morning. Do you
hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yassir!" responded Bob, his mouth already
watering for the share he expected to
eat of the good things thus promised.
</p>

<p>
"And, Bob, tell Uncle Joe to take them over
there himself and say that Mas' Boyd Westover
hopes the folks will have a good time and get
as much religion as they need."
</p>

<p>
"But, Boyd," said Jack Towns, who had
sleepily strolled into the porch, "don't you
think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, decidedly not, Jack. You see Wanalah
is the plantation nearest to Mount Moriah,
and it's the natural base of supplies for a meeting
there. If I don't furnish the provender
they'll steal it out of my pasture, my pig pen
and my turkey yard. I very much prefer that
they should get the things honestly, and it costs
me no more."
</p>

<p>
Then, returning to business, he said to the
overseer:
</p>

<p>
"You understand the general spirit of my
instructions, Mr. Wilkinson, and I beg you to
bear it in mind. I'll give more specific orders
from time to time, as they are needed."
</p>

<p>
"But what about me?" answered the overseer.
"I've got a reputation for makin' more
tobacco to the hand an' more wheat to the acre
an' more corn on top o' that than any other
man as oversees a plantation anywheres for
forty mile around here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's this a ways. I ain't a-goin' to
lose a reputation I prides myself on. Ef you
don't want your niggers worked fer all they's
worth, perhaps you'd better look out fer another
overseer."
</p>

<p>
Westover flushed angrily, more at the tone
than at the words, and answered instantly:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I had. At any rate I will. I
shall not renew my contract with you for another
year."
</p>

<p>
The Virginians were very tolerant of insolence
on the part of a negro. Usually they
treated it as badinage, quite harmlessly and
humorously meant. But insolence on the part
of an overseer was always taken seriously and
instantly resented. The overseers constituted
a pariah class, for whom there was tolerance
only so long as they "minded their manners."
</p>

<p>
As the overseer lingered in hope of some
modification of the sentence he had brought
upon himself, Westover impatiently turned
upon him, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I think I have nothing more to say to you,
Mr. Wilkinson, and I wish to talk with Mr.
Towns. You may go now."
</p>

<p>
As the man walked down the road that led
to the outer gates, he muttered:
</p>

<p>
"I'll git back at him for that. He's a sneak-in'
abolitionist. I'll be over at Fighting Creek
to-morrow, seein's he's made it a holiday here."
</p>

<p>
"Now I want to talk with you, Jack," said
Westover when the man was well out of earshot.
</p>

<p>
"So I understood you to say to Mr. Wilkinson;
and you may go on and talk to me
till the cows come home, if it amuses you to do
so, but if you expect me to talk back in any
rational way, you've simply got to wait till
after breakfast. When I've had two cups of
coffee, the best part of a roe herring, three or
four slices of cold ham, a wedge or two of hot
light bread, some beaten biscuit, and one of
your belated cantaloupes, I shall begin to appreciate
the fact that I have a brain. Till then
I decline to consider myself a rational being.
Go on and talk, if you want to."
</p>

<p>
"I will," answered Westover, passing into
the house. To one of the dining-room servants
he said:
</p>

<p>
"Serve a pot of coffee to Mr. Towns immediately,
do you hear? Is it ready?"
</p>

<p>
Half a minute later Cilla appeared in the
porch bearing a tray with coffee and its accessories
daintily arranged upon a napkin.
The servants at Wanalah had not yet lost their
memory of the training they had received in
youth.
</p>

<p>
"There," said Westover, "saturate your
soul and stimulate your system with coffee.
And by the way, there's a frost-bitten tomato
sliced up to deceive your eyes and your appetite.
How long before breakfast, Cilla?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a-bein' brung in now," answered the
serving girl, "all but the hot buckwheat cakes,
an' them'll come a little later."
</p>

<p>
It was the custom of the Virginians to talk
freely at table, paying no heed whatever to the
presence of their servitors. Accordingly, as
soon as Jack Towns began to discover his
brains again, under the influence of a breakfast
that might have made a chatterer of the Sphinx
itself, the two talked of plans.
</p>

<p>
"My first endeavor," said Westover, "will
be to compel Colonel Conway to declare himself.
To that end, as soon as breakfast is done,
I shall send him a letter that will require a response
of some sort. You see, Jack, his attitude
is far more hurtful to me than the most
aggressive antagonism on his part could be.
Everybody knows that the Westovers and the
Conways have been the most intimate friends
possible throughout generations past. If he
and I had had a quarrel, everybody would understand.
But we have had no quarrel, and so
nobody understands and everybody wonders.
If he believes I was guilty down there in Richmond&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He can't think that, unless he's an idiot
of extraordinary capacity for the lunatic misinterpretation
of facts," interrupted Towns.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not. Still, I remember hearing a
'Pennsylvania Dutch' magistrate declare from
the bench that 'Nodings is possible mit Gott,'
and so it may be that, he believes that. If so
he has a perfect right to express his belief.
All I ask is that he shall say what it is he has
against me."
</p>

<p>
"Stuff and nonsense! Rot and rubbish!
Scammony and gamboge! Moonlight, music,
love and flowers! Transcendentalism and
green cheese!" exclaimed Jack Towns, multiplying
words as a man of oratorical habit is
apt to do. "You know perfectly well that he
believes nothing of the sort. Recall our conversation
of last night."
</p>

<p>
"I remember it perfectly, and that is why
I'm going to write to Colonel Conway this
morning. It may open the way to an explanation."
</p>

<p>
"It may, of course. But if I were in your
place I'd write to Margaret instead."
</p>

<p>
"How can I? I have written to her again
and again, and she has not answered. Self-respect
forbids me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand. It was self-respect
that caused a cat to lose an eye in a scrimmage
rather than explain to the other cat that the
fence he was sitting on was the personal property
of his own master. Never mind. If you
won't write to Margaret, write to her father
by all means. It may provoke a crisis of
some sort, and that is the one thing to be desired
just now."
</p>

<p>
But Boyd Westover was not destined to send
that letter. He toiled over it half the day and
more. He wrote it in forty different forms.
He used up more letter paper than had been
consumed at Wanalah during a year or more
past, but he could not get the thing into a shape
that would do. Finally he threw down his
pen and turning to Jack Towns said:
</p>

<p>
"The trouble is, Jack, that when I try to
formulate my complaint there isn't a thing to
challenge or question. Colonel Conway has
not been here to call upon me, but I cannot
decently complain of that. He has refused to
join with others in nominating me, but that too
was his right and I cannot question it. The
whole thing is so negative that really there isn't
a point I can mention as a ground of complaint."
</p>

<p>
"Yes? Well&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well, what? Why don't you say
something?"
</p>

<p>
"I will. I'll say that you're irritable to-day.
You showed it your confab with your overseer,
who is a very worthy man with an exaggerated
notion of the work a field hand ought to do in
a day. You showed it at breakfast, when you
complained because the buckwheat cakes didn't
make their appearance precisely on time. Is
there anything else you'd like me to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. What am I to do in this matter,
by way of bringing about a tolerable situation?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, nothing, of course. I could have told
you that this morning, but you wouldn't have
believed it then. Now that you've exhausted
your literary capacity and most of the Wanalah
stationery in a futile effort to do the impossible,
it may be worth my while to say to
you that in a case of this kind there is nothing
you can do except await events with due respect
for your own dignity. Shut up your
desk and send for some horses. Let's have a
gallop before dinner time. And by the way,
I'd like to ride that young iron gray mare
you've got in your stables. She impresses me
so favorably that I should buy her if she belonged
to anybody who would sell."
</p>

<p>
"Why, when did you inspect her, Jack? I
hadn't a thought&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know you hadn't, but while you've been
busy at your desk, trying to accomplish the
impossible, I've been down to the stables and
had the mare out for inspection. She's a
beauty and, so far as I know the points of a
horse, she has all of them that are worth while.
She's a Red Eye of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;Red Eye and Nina. She's Nina's
own colt. I'll tell you what I'll do, Jack. If
you'll stay with me, making Wanalah your
home till this confounded election is over,&mdash;just
to keep me sane, you know,&mdash;the mare
shall be yours, as a souvenir of your safe return
from the Rocky Mountains."
</p>

<p>
"Done!" exclaimed Jack. "But if I have
to club you by way of keeping you sane, you
won't too greatly mind, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least. It's the clubbing I want.
Really, Jack, I often think I haven't quite
grown up and never shall. I have my full
complement of inches, of course, and I can be
dignified upon occasion, but when it comes to
emotional things, somehow&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Somehow you're nothing but a romantic,
sentimental boy. I've heard you quote Keats
and Shelley when an arithmetic or a geography
would have been much more to the purpose.
I was born that way myself, and so you see
I understand your malady and sympathize with
you, but as for myself I've worked a complete
cure."
</p>

<p>
"How did you manage it, Jack?" asked
Westover in amused anticipation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, easily enough. I have cultivated
catholicity of taste in the matter of girls.
You know all sentimentality in men has its ultimate
origin in their attitude toward women.
Now in sentiment, as in everything else, moderation
is desirable and excess is destructive.
Realizing that fact I have cultivated moderation,
by falling madly in love with every pretty
young woman I have met, and with some pretty
old ones also. But as one encounters a rapid
succession of pretty young women, the habit
of falling in love with each of them is a securely
protective agency. You see I never
have time to become idiotically in love with
one young woman before meeting another
who knocks all that out of my head. To-day's
girl rescues me from yesterday's. It's a case
of one nail driving out another."
</p>

<p>
"You are the worst cynic I ever knew,
Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I am. But I see the boys are here
with the horses. Let's be off and away, forgetting
philosophy and girls and pessimism
and moonlight and molasses candy for a time
at least. Is that a quarter of shoat Cilla is
toting from the ice-house? In verity it is, and
a decent respect for its succulent attractiveness
should prompt us to arm ourselves and meet
it with an appetite. So here goes for a good
hard gallop, with stiff fences by the way."

<br />
THE EVENTS OF A DAY
</h3>

<p>
Only once had Westover been interrupted
during his hours of laborious
and futile effort to write his letter to
Colonel Conway. Jack Towns, being an ideal
guest, had occupied himself with books, strolls,
and other silent means of passing the time, so
that his host had been in no way reminded of
his existence. But the weather had not been
so unobtrusive a guest. Considerably before
noon there came a squall which for ten or fifteen
minutes threatened destruction to everything
movable about the place. It unroofed a
cellar door at the back of the house. It carried
away the shed of a tobacco barn, and
curiously enough one of the cook's pigs, which
she was bringing up luxuriously on "pot
liquor and kitchen stuff," disappeared during
the brief hurricane. Whether the obese
porker was really blown away, as most of
the house servants stoutly contended, or
whether it was that some colored person
with an appetite had simultaneously seized
the opportunity and the pig and got away
with both, was a point never accurately determined.
</p>

<p>
Boyd Westover cared nothing for damages
that might be repaired, but he was sorely distressed
by the wreckage of a favorite mimosa
tree that flourished near one corner of the
porch. He even quitted his writing, when the
little squall had passed away, and with Jack
Towns's very inexpert assistance, attempted
some repairs. But when there arose the question
of sawing off a broken limb, he abandoned
the undertaking, saying:
</p>

<p>
"We'll leave that till Carley Farnsworth
comes. He's due here to-day to see some of
my people who are ill. He's a much better
horticulturist than either of us, Jack, and besides
he's a surgeon and will know better how
to give the poor tree a chance to grow into
symmetry again."
</p>

<p>
Then, as he sorrowfully contemplated the
torn and broken mimosa, he muttered:
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have cared half so much if the
squall had blown away every barn I've got.
The ruin of that tree is all that it means to
me."
</p>

<p>
He little dreamed what other and immeasurably
greater consequences were to come to
him as the result of that brief atmospheric disturbance,
but he was destined, after a time, to
find out.
</p>

<p>
When the two friends returned from their
ride of a dozen miles or so, bringing with them
a pair of wild turkey gobblers shot upon the
flush, they found Carley Farnsworth in the
hall, as the broad passageway through a Virginia
house was called, very busily writing
upon small slips of paper, of which he had prepared
a considerable number before beginning
to write. He was too busy to give more than
a scant greeting to his friends, but in lieu of
greater cordiality he handed one of his written
slips to each, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Read that, and don't interrupt me, please.
I'm expecting a messenger every moment."
</p>

<p>
On each of the slips was written:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I am authorized by Colonel Robert Conway
to add his name to the list of those who
urge Mr. Boyd Westover's election.
</p>

<p>
"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Don Carlos Farnsworth.</span>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As Westover and Towns looked wonderingly
at each other, after reading the slips,
Carley Farnsworth threw down his pen, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"There! that's fifty. Talk will do the rest."
</p>

<p>
Then, filling and lighting a long-stemmed
pipe, he said to the others:
</p>

<p>
"Something has happened. Don't ask me
what it is, for I don't know. Yonder comes
Dick Ventress, and the slips are ready for him.
He has a pot of gum stick'em in his pocket
and he's going to paste those slips to all the
nominating placards within twenty miles between
now and to-morrow morning. They'll
set everybody talking, and talk will do the
rest."
</p>

<p>
When Dick Ventress had received the papers
and galloped away, Carley vouchsafed some
small and exceedingly unsatisfying explanation.
</p>

<p>
"Something has happened at The Oaks," he
said. "I don't know what it is, but when I
got there to-day to attend Miss Margaret's
sick people, I found everybody agitated, Miss
Betsy in something like collapse, and Colonel
Conway littering up the house with the torn
fragments of letters he'd been trying to write
but couldn't. I gave him something to quiet
his nerves, and suggested that in his state of
mind perhaps literary endeavors were unadvisable.
Presently he exclaimed: 'I'll arrange
the whole thing. I'll write a letter to
you.'
</p>

<p>
"With that he set to work and wrote
this."
</p>

<p>
He offered a sheet of paper on which was
written:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<span class="smcap">Dr. D. C. Farnsworth.</span>
</p>

<p>
"<i>My dear Sir</i>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"When you asked me to join you and others
in nominating Mr. Boyd Westover for
Senator, I felt bound to decline, for reasons
which I did not, because I could not, offer.
Through very distressing and to me embarrassing
circumstances, I now discover that I
have been acting under a misapprehension.
There are peculiar circumstances which forbid
me to explain myself further. I cannot do so
without injustice to others. But so far as Mr.
Boyd Westover is concerned I earnestly desire
to make such atonement as is still possible.
To that end I hereby authorize you to add my
name to the list of those who urge Mr. Boyd
Westover's election. You are free to make
this public in any and every way that may
seem to you desirable. If it were possible, I
should myself announce it from the platform
at Fighting Creek to-morrow. As it is I authorize
you to do so in my absence. I beg
you to use all the influence you can command
to spare me the necessity of explanation in
this case. I cannot explain. The situation is
the most distressing one possible to me. I
place it and myself in your hands, and I am
always, my dear Dr. Farnsworth,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Your sincere friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "<span class="smcap">Robert Conway</span>."<br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
"There you have the whole story, so far as
I know anything about it," said the Doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I must say," said Jack Towns, "it is a
very manly effort to make reparation under
difficulties."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Westover, "and that is
characteristic of Colonel Conway. I'd gladly
sacrifice the election in exchange for the privilege
of reading that note. He is altogether
a man, and I must meet his manliness as a
man. I'll write to him at once."
</p>

<p>
"He does not invite that," said Jack Towns.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary he forbids it," added
Carley Farnsworth, "and I forbid it in his
name. Your impulse is manly and generous,
Boyd, but you see he has asked me to use all
the influence I can to spare him the necessity
of explaining. A note from you would simply
compel an explanation at his hands. It
was to avoid that that he tore up all the letters
he tried to write to you to-day. It is to avoid
that that he doesn't mount his horse and ride
over here to shake hands with you and tell
you about this thing, whatever it is. It is to
avoid that that he is going to absent himself
from the meeting at Fighting Creek to-morrow,
leaving me to announce his change of
mind in his stead. What do you think, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's only one thing to think. Until
Colonel Conway shall see fit to open direct
communication with Westover of Wanalah, it
will be an extreme and unpardonable impertinence
for Westover of Wanalah to address
any personal communication to him. Circumstances
forbid it. Courtesy forbids it. Consideration,
conscience, common sense, convenience,
convention, custom,&mdash;everything that
begins with a 'c' or with any other letter of
the alphabet,&mdash;forbids it."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you two are right," answered
Westover, "but to a man of my temperament
it seems an ungracious thing not to recognize
in some personal way the courtesy Colonel
Conway has shown me. My impulse is to
write to him and thank him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, under the circumstances you
mustn't," said Carley Farnsworth, "and
you're lucky, Boyd, to have sane friends to
advise and control you."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I am. But really, Carley, what
do you suppose has happened over at The
Oaks?"
</p>

<p>
"I am doing no supposing. It may be anything
or nothing. We Virginians&mdash;all but
Jack Towns and me&mdash;are so emotional, so
sentimental, so chivalric if you prefer the term,
that I long ago ceased my efforts to make a
diagnosis of things of that sort. I only know
that the Colonel is wrought up to a pitch that
requires the remedy of going to bed, and that
everybody else at The Oaks is correspondingly
wrought up. Everybody except that thoroughly
admirable Boston girl, Miss Danvers.
She has a head, and she keeps it poised above
her shoulders. If I hadn't an entirely satisfactory
wife of my own in prospect, though
not yet in possession, I should be strongly
tempted to persuade that girl to stay south
of Mason and Dixon's line. As it is, I really
think some other fellow ought to do that as
a service to Virginia society. Miss Danvers
is a true blue, a thoroughbred. She has character,
manners, breeding, beauty, simplicity,
honesty, sincerity, loyalty, good sense, and all
the other qualities that go to make a woman
admirable. She is the only person who knows
what the ruction over at The Oaks was, and
she's the only one there capable of handling the
situation sanely. She seems to have everybody
there well in hand, and to be controlling
all of them wisely. She has a persuasive gift
that astonished me when she actually got Colonel
Conway to go to bed in the middle of the
afternoon, and induced Margaret to do the
same thing as a precaution against a nervous
breakdown that was clearly threatened. I had
ordered both those goings to bed, with all the
authority of a medical adviser, but to no purpose.
When I spoke to that Boston girl about
it, she answered gently but confidently: 'If
you think that advisable, Doctor, I will see
that it is done,' and by Jove she did the trick
so promptly that before I left I saw them both
in bed, and gave each of them a sleeping potion
that will keep them quiet for many hours
to come."
</p>

<p>
Under ordinary circumstances, Jack Towns
would have declared his purpose to go over
to The Oaks at once and make love to the
Boston girl. For some reason, on this occasion,
he shrank from all jesting. He had
talked for an hour with Millicent Danvers on
the evening before. He wanted now to talk
with her for another hour, but, contrary to
his custom, he said nothing of his purpose.
He went to dinner with the other two, and
after the dinner was done he slipped away to
the stables, mounted the superb mare that was
now his, and rode away to The Oaks.

XXIX
<br />
THE WORK OF A WILD WIND
</h3>

<p>
This is the story of what the wind-storm
did at The Oaks, to disturb the
usual placidity of life there.
</p>

<p>
It was Aunt Betsy's custom, as it was that
of many or most other women in Virginia, to
write a multitude of "notes" each day, some
of them filling six or eight sheets of paper,
with criss-crossings to make them seem undecipherably
interesting, and to despatch them by
young negroes on bare-backed horses to their
more or less neighborly destination. A statistical
economist once made a careful reckoning
by which he convinced himself that this
practice cost the planter families of Virginia
about seven and one-half times the amount
they contributed in stamps to the postal revenues
of the nation.
</p>

<p>
It was the practice of the young women
of the plantations to write all these letters
before breakfast. It was Aunt Betsy's more
leisurely practice to write them whenever she
pleased, and she usually pleased to write them
between ten o'clock in the morning and the
one o'clock hour that was sacred to the luncheon
known in Virginia as "snack."
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the happening at The
Oaks, the day being sufficiently warm, Aunt
Betsy brought out her desk&mdash;an oblong box
which when opened offered a slanting writing
surface, with spaces below its lids for letter
paper, envelopes, and papers of every kind.
Women usually laid these so-called "desks"
upon their laps and managed somehow to write
there, as no man ever could have done. But
it was Aunt Betsy's habit also to retire into the
house now and then upon occasions of real or
imagined necessity, and in anticipation of such
interruptions she always had a slender-legged
stand at hand&mdash;a thing "drunkenly artistic,"
as Boyd Westover had once said&mdash;upon
which to place her desk whenever she was
minded to suspend her writing for a while.
</p>

<p>
On the morning in question she had a gown
in course of construction by her seamstresses,
who were working in the back porch with a
room opening off it which her modesty used
for purposes of "fitting" and "trying on."
</p>

<p>
She had therefore frequent occasion to suspend
her writing.
</p>

<p>
It was during one of her most exigent fits
of trying on that the squall struck the place.
As a good deal of thunder and lightning accompanied
the weather disturbance, and as
Aunt Betsy was possessed of that sort of cowardice
concerning thunder and lightning which
persons so afflicted call "nervousness," she
promptly shut herself up in a dark closet and
remained there until the squall had passed
away.
</p>

<p class="illustration">
<a id="img-342"></a>
<img src="images/img-342.jpg" alt="With the first onset of the wind." />
<br />
<span class="smcap">With the first onset of the wind.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 343.</i>
</p>

<p>
But with the first onset of the wind the
frail table on which she had left her open desk
toppled over; the desk was whirled out into
the grounds and dashed against a tree with a
force that instantly reduced it to splinters,
while its contents&mdash;correspondence and curl
papers alike&mdash;were scattered, if not to the
four winds, at least to the one wind which was
blowing with demoniacal fury.
</p>

<p>
Margaret and Millicent who had just returned
from a morning stroll rushed frantically,
picturesquely and, in an unconscious
way, gracefully, to the rescue. The desk
was in fragments and far past praying for;
but by a deal of scurrying the two girls and
some of the house servants managed to collect
the scattered papers and place them upon a
table within, while Aunt Betsy was still ensconced
in her dark closet, waiting for the last
rumble of the thunder to cease. As Millicent
deposited her share of the spoils upon the
table, she looked at Margaret with frightened
eyes and said:
</p>

<p>
"Please send everybody out of the room
but you and me."
</p>

<p>
For Millicent had not yet accustomed herself
to talk freely in the presence of servants
as if they were deaf, dumb, and blind, incapable
of understanding what might be said in
their presence and therefore incapable of repeating
it. That habit of the Virginians had
its origin probably in two facts: they never
said anything that they were afraid to stand
by; and the negro was not, in law or in fact,
permitted to testify against a white person. In
the courts his testimony was barred by statute;
in social life it was even more absolutely
barred by convention. No negro ventured to
report anything he had heard white people
say, and if he had done so, no white person
would for one moment have listened to him.
To have done that would have been to invite
and incur absolute and eternal ostracism.
</p>

<p>
But Millicent, brought up in a totally different
atmosphere, could never accustom herself
to this, and so she asked to have the servants
dismissed from the room before saying
what she had to say about the papers in her
hand. Margaret smiled at the request, but
after the revelation was made she rejoiced
that it had been preferred and acted upon.
</p>

<p>
When the servants had left the room, Millicent
held out a handful of letters that she had
picked up in the wild scramble of rescue.
</p>

<p>
"There is something wrong here, Margaret,"
she said in her open, honest way.
"Some of these are unopened letters addressed
to you&mdash;letters that bear stamps and
post marks, letters that have come through the
mail. These others are sealed letters addressed
in your handwriting to Mr. Boyd
Westover. They are stamped, but they bear
no postmarks. They have never been mailed."
</p>

<p>
She stood silent for a moment, rigid with
an indignation that she knew not how to express
in words.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Margaret stood looking at the
letters, dazed, pale to the lips, paralyzed. Then
she looked from the letters to Millicent and
the girl thought she was dying or already dead,
so white was her face at first and so livid a
moment later.
</p>

<p>
With the womanly instinct of ministry, reinforced
by a passionate impulse of friendship,
Millicent passed around the table, threw her
arm about the stricken girl and gently forced
her to lie upon one of the broad lounges or
settees, or whatever else they should be called,
that in those days invited repose in every
dining room and every hallway of the plantation
houses.
</p>

<p>
With that ready appreciation of necessity
which is characteristic of womanhood, she
went to the sideboard, poured a thimble glass
of sherry and compelled Margaret to drink
it. Then she tinkled a bell and when the servant
appeared gave quick, concise orders for the
summoning of Margaret's maid and other
strong-armed servitors.
</p>

<p>
"You must get your mistress to bed at
once," she commanded, "and send some one
to summon Dr. Farnsworth quickly. He's at
the lower quarters."
</p>

<p>
But Margaret, rising to a sitting position,
promptly negatived all this. Sustained by
wrath, indignation, resentment of insult, and
by outraged pride, she forced upon herself the
calm control that for the moment she had lost,
though only for the moment. With that instinct
of race, that courage, that self-mastery
that had been always a precious possession
of the Conways, she dismissed the superfluous
servants who had hastened to her upon hearing
that she was in trouble, and assumed control
of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Millicent, dear, for bringing
those letters to me. They are mine, and I
will dispose of them. Diana, bring me my
desk, please."
</p>

<p>
When the desk was placed before her she
selected a sheet of paper and an envelope as
calmly as if she had meant to send a note to
Hallie Harvey or any other girl friend, asking
her for the proper count of stitches in a piece
of fancy knitting work.
</p>

<p>
Then she wrote upon the sheet of paper,
this note:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Aunt Betsy</span>:&mdash;Your desk was blown
out into the grounds and wrecked, during the
squall. We have gathered up the fragments
of the desk and rescued all the widely scattered
papers. I am sending you all of them
that in any way belong to you. Those that
belong to me I am keeping. I send you this
note, instead of seeing you in person, because
your maid tells me you have gone to bed.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<span class="smcap">Margaret.</span>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She sent the note, sealed, by the hand of
a maid, and she sent with it the entire paper
contents of the wrecked desk, except the unopened
letters of Boyd Westover to herself
and her own unopened letters to him. These
she gathered together into a bundle which she
thrust into her corsage.
</p>

<p>
Then she turned to a servant and gave the
order:
</p>

<p>
"Send to the stables for saddle horses for
your Miss Millicent and me. We are going
for a ride."
</p>

<p>
To Millicent she said under her breath:
"You must go with me, dear. I must control
myself or I shall not be able to carry this thing
through to the end with dignity. I must have
a dash on horseback. You don't mind, do you,
dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Mind? <i>I mind</i>, Margaret? Why, you
know that I would ride to the ends of the earth
with you and for you, even under ordinary
circumstances. Now that you're in trouble,
of course I am ready. I don't know the facts&mdash;though
I guess some of them&mdash;and I don't
understand all that these things mean, but I
know you have been wronged, outraged,
placed in a false position, humiliated by some
trespass upon your privacy or your personality,
and I am here to stand by you till the
wrong is righted, the outrage undone, and the
humiliation lifted from your spirit. I'll do
anything, everything&mdash;oh, Margaret, you
don't know how I love you or how eager I
am to help you!"
</p>

<p>
Margaret looked at her with loving and
teary eyes. Presently she said:
</p>

<p>
"I know it all, dear. And yet you Yankees
are supposed to be cold and calculating and
hard. How utterly mistaken people are in
their judgments! But here are the horses.
We'll have a spin, and then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused as if in doubt and apprehension.
Presently she added:
</p>

<p>
"And then I must confront my father. He
is the proper person and he must set this thing
right."
</p>

<p>
After a brisk gallop of half a mile, Margaret
reined her horse down to a walk, and
entered into conversation with her friend.
</p>

<p>
"I feel, Millicent," she began, "that I ought
to take you completely into my confidence, and
tell you all that this thing means. Your loyalty
and your affection deserve that. But
there are reasons which I cannot explain that
forbid so full a confidence. I am going to
tell you all I can, and I want you to believe
and know that whatever reserves I practise are
practised solely for your sake."
</p>

<p>
"But how can that be, Margaret? Of
course you are to tell me as much or as little
as you please, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I see. I can't explain. I can only say
that if I practise reserve at all, it is only because
of my tender affection for you. Can
you believe that blindly, without explanation?
And will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe whatever you tell me, Margaret,
and I do not wish to hear anything that for
any reason you do not wish me to hear."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, dear," said the agitated girl
as she again pressed her horse to his paces;
"God help me if I'm wrong!"
</p>

<p>
There was so strong a suggestion of tragedy
in the girl's tone that Millicent felt herself
called upon to interfere with Margaret's purpose,
which she instinctively understood and
which seemed to her scarcely less than suicidal.
She said nothing so long as the horses were
moving swiftly. When they resumed the walk,
she turned to her companion and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe in my friendship, Margaret,
and do you trust its loyalty so far as to
forgive an impertinence in its behalf?"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly do, Millicent. I could
never&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, then, and don't interrupt. I know
far more about this matter than anybody has
ever told me. My woman's instinct has instructed
me. It may be in error as to details,
but I am right as to the essentials, and in such
a case it is the essentials alone that need be
considered. I'll tell you the story of the situation
as I understand it. You are not a woman
to love lightly, or lightly to forget."
</p>

<p>
Margaret well nigh fell from her horse as
she heard her own passionately uttered words
thus repeated in merely explanatory fashion,
but in a moment she realized that this was
purely a coincidence. Millicent had chosen the
words for herself; she could not have heard
them as a quotation.
</p>

<p>
"There may be many fancies to a woman
like you, but there can be only one passionate,
self-giving, all-surrendering love. It is commonly
said that there is no such thing as self-sacrificing
loyalty or friendship between women&mdash;that
while we may heroically sacrifice ourselves
for the love of a man we never sacrifice
that love in loyalty to a woman. It is
a slander on our sex. I accepted it as true
until very recently; indeed I saw many things
to confirm it. I know better now."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a considerable time, but
Margaret did not prompt her to go on. Perhaps
she foresaw what was coming, and at
any rate she saw clearly that there was struggle
and disturbance in Millicent's mind.
</p>

<p>
After awhile the girl resumed:
</p>

<p>
"The one love of your life, Margaret, is
for Mr. Boyd Westover. It began long before
you knew it and it will last as long as
you live. Now I am going to make a shameful
confession," she added. Then she broke
into a gallop, but when the horses resumed
a moderate pace she did not make the confession.
Perhaps she shrank from it. Perhaps
she deemed it unnecessary. Perhaps she
thought its making might tend rather to complicate
than to simplify the problems in hand.
However that may be, she made no further
reference to the matter, but took up her parable
where she had laid it down.
</p>

<p>
"Something, I don't know what&mdash;yes, I
do, but I don't know why&mdash;has come between
you and Mr. Boyd Westover. I am not blind,
and I think I am not stupid. There were
unopened letters there from him to you, and
other unopened letters from you to him. Without
asking anybody any questions I know that
for some reason somebody has sought to cut
off communication between him and you. I
see clearly that that purpose has been accomplished,
and I see that as a consequence he
has been thinking you fickle and treacherous,
as women so often are, and you have
been thinking him disloyal and dishonorable."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no," interrupted Margaret. "I
have never accused him of disloyalty or dishonor,
even in my wildest moments of perplexity
and distress. I have never for one
moment doubted his honor. It is only that
I have been unable to conjecture why he left
me in silence, when in fact he was writing
great, manly, loving letters to me every day.
Oh, Millicent, it was cruel, and I can never
forgive&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not need mention the name.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't read Mr. Westover's unopened
letters," suggested Millicent.
</p>

<p>
"No, I have no right now. They were
written in the past, when he loved and trusted
me. He might not wish me to read them now.
He might not feel in the same way toward me
now that he did then."
</p>

<p>
"That's stuff and nonsense, I think, Margaret.
I really do. If I were you I should read
the letters carefully. Then I should sit down
and write to Mr. Boyd Westover, enclosing
the letters you wrote to him at that time and
explaining how all the trouble had come
about."
</p>

<p>
"That would never, never do. It would
be throwing myself like a cast-off garment at
his feet. It would be asking him to renew
relations that he may have been glad to forget."
</p>

<p>
"You say that, Margaret, but you don't believe
it. Neither do I."
</p>

<p>
"I think, Millicent, you don't understand
our conventionalities down here. It would be
impossible for any Virginia girl, under such
circumstances, to take the initiative in reopening
relations. That is the prerogative of the
gentleman in the case."
</p>

<p>
"But when the gentleman doesn't know the
facts, and the woman does, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"That makes no possible difference."
</p>

<p>
"You are right on one point, Margaret. I
do not understand your conventions, nor do I
in the least sympathize with them. They are
shams and falsities, as all conventionalities are,
and they are cruel beyond measure. They
decree that where a mistake has been made
and the woman discovers it, she must let wreck
and ruin overwhelm two lives&mdash;her own and
that of the man she loves&mdash;rather than send
to him a simple and easy explanation of the
mistake that has made the trouble. No, I do
not understand such conventions. What are
you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll place the whole thing in my father's
hands, and he shall do what he will with it."
</p>

<p>
"And as to the one who has wrought all
this mischief?"
</p>

<p>
"My relations with my Aunt Betsy will be
changed. Come! We must hurry back to
the house. I want my father to know what
has happened."
</p>

<p>
They trotted on for a space, when suddenly
Millicent reined in her horse and Margaret
stopped in company, for Millicent had come to
a complete halt in the roadway. For a moment
the two confronted each other without
a word, for Millicent, sitting on her horse with
compressed lips and set jaw, did not at first
explain herself. After a while she said:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot sit idly by and see two glorious
young lives wrecked when a next to nothing
would save both. I am a Yankee, of Boston,
but so was Paul Revere. Let me have those
letters. Ask me no questions, but let me ride
as Paul Revere did!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Margaret hesitated. The
temptation was very great, but she put it
aside.
</p>

<p>
"That would never do, Millicent," she said.
"I understand your loving loyalty and I am
grateful for it, but that would never do. To
Mr. Westover you would be my emissary, no
matter what you might say. It would be the
same as if I went to him myself."
</p>

<p>
"Is your decision final, or may I argue the
matter?" Millicent asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is final," Margaret answered, and not
another word was spoken during the remainder
of the homeward journey.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap30"></a>
XXX
<br />
WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE OAKS
</h3>

<p>
That little jaunt on horseback that
Margaret, with her friend, took by way
of steadying her nerves, was
perhaps a mistake. If she had gone to her
father at once, while "Aunt Betsy" was
making herself comfortable in bed, the impulsive
old gentleman would have been off on
a journey to Wanalah within five minutes, and
his intent to explain and make reparation
would have accomplished its purpose instantly.
</p>

<p>
But Margaret went riding instead, and no
sooner did "Aunt Betsy" learn of the fact
than she made a quick recovery from her illness,
and almost before the two young women
were out of sight of the house, "Aunt Betsy,"
tearful and in every other way appealing, was
closeted with Colonel Conway. She thus
gained the distinct advantage of being first on
the ground. Her tears and her agitation appealed
strongly to the protective instinct of
the chivalric old soldier. She told him in her
own way what had happened, diverting his
attention from her own misconduct by lamentations
and copious weepings and protestations
that in all she had done she had sought only
to protect the honor and dignity of the family
and to prevent Margaret&mdash;"an unformed
girl"&mdash;from compromising herself in her ignorance
of the world.
</p>

<p>
It would be too much to say that she convinced
her brother of the righteousness of her
conduct. Tampering with letters&mdash;even
without reading them&mdash;was to him a point
of special sensitiveness, and there were other
matters involved which he could in no wise
reconcile with his conceptions of honorable
conduct. But he recognized the weakness of
women as a palliation of misconduct, and his
sister's tearful appeals to him for the protection
of her dignity affected him in the tenderest
part of his nature.
</p>

<p>
He was profoundly displeased with her, but
she was his sister, nevertheless, and he was
her natural protector. It was his duty and his
desire to spare her, so far as might be possible,
but he felt also the obligation to censure and
correct her.
</p>

<p>
"You have done a gravely improper thing,
Betsy," he said, with sternness and tenderness
struggling for mastery in his tone. "Indeed
what you have done is unpardonable, inexcusable,&mdash;except
that as a woman you did not
know the enormity of your act."
</p>

<p>
"That is the main point, Robert," she interrupted,
"and I beg you to bear it in mind.
All I did was done with good intentions. I
am naturally solicitous for the honor of our
family, and I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you did a dishonorable thing in that
behalf," he said with severity in his tone.
"In your desire to protect the family
name you did a thing that would forever
subject it to shame, if it should become
known."
</p>

<p>
"That is it, Robert. It mustn't become
known. I depend upon you, as the head of
the family, to prevent that. Blame me as
severely as you will, but don't expose me, don't
subject me to criticism and scorn! Oh, Robert,
I beg you to protect me!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll protect you of course," he replied,
"but you have made it difficult and exceedingly
embarrassing for me to do so. I have
my own conscience to reckon with. You have
made me do things, in ignorance of the facts&mdash;I
may as well be frank and say you have
deliberately deceived me into the doing of
wrongs for which I know not how to atone
or even apologize. If you were not my sister,
if you were not under my protection, if I
could be indifferent to your feelings&mdash;my
course would be simple and easy. A frank,
manly statement of the facts would exonerate
me. As it is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As it is, Robert, you cannot subject your
sister to humiliation. You <i>must</i> protect me
from shame. You must take pains that what
has happened shall never be known outside
this house!"
</p>

<p>
It was at this stage of the conversation that
Margaret entered. "Aunt Betsy," confident
that she had secured herself, said:
</p>

<p>
"I will leave you to talk with your father,
Margaret, if you desire."
</p>

<p>
"No," the young woman answered; "I
prefer that you should remain. I, at least,
have nothing to conceal, and I do not seek, as
you do, to get my father's ear in private. Besides,
I have some things to say to you, and I
prefer to say them in my father's presence. I
am mistress of The Oaks. Hitherto, out of a
respect which you have not justified, I have
permitted you to exercise certain functions
that belong to me. I shall do so no longer.
I have given directions that hereafter I will
make up the outgoing mail bag and open the
incoming one."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear child&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am not a child, Aunt Betsy. You have
made some grievous mistakes in forgetfulness
of that fact. It shall not be forgotten again
while I remain mistress of this plantation.
What was it you were going to say, Aunt
Betsy? I beg pardon for interrupting, but it
seemed necessary."
</p>

<p>
"I was going to ask what the servants will
think."
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what they will think, Aunt
Betsy."
</p>

<p>
"On that point I must appeal to your father,"
"Aunt Betsy" replied.
</p>

<p>
"On that point it is <i>very dangerous for you
to appeal</i>," answered the younger woman, still
preserving an extraordinary calm that was at
once astonishing and alarming to her aunt,
but speaking with a degree of emphasis that
suggested something behind the words.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean? Explain yourself,"
said "Aunt Betsy," in that authoritative tone
which she had all her life employed in addressing
her niece.
</p>

<p>
"I will explain if you wish," Margaret answered;
"but I'd rather spare you the explanation."
</p>

<p>
"I insist upon knowing what you mean,"
the elder woman unwisely replied.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then; you shall hear. In addition
to the wrong you have done me, wrecking
my life and placing me in a grievously false
position; in addition to the wrong you have
done to another, you have been guilty of the
crime of robbing the United States mails,
Aunt Betsy, and as the minimum penalty of
that crime is a long term in prison, I do not
think it wise of you to suggest appeals in this
case. It will be better, I think, to accept my
decision as final."
</p>

<p class="illustration">

<br />
<span class="smcap">It will be better, I think, to accept my decision as final.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 365.</i>
</p>

<p>
The old lady rose in wrath, alarm, indignation
and all the other emotions of an exciting
sort, and demanded to know what her
niece meant by such an accusation of infamy.
At the same time Colonel Conway exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, daughter, daughter, you do not mean
what you say. Take it back! You are excited.
You are beside yourself!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not in the least excited," the young
woman answered. "I did not wish or intend
to mention that aspect of the matter, but Aunt
Betsy insisted upon it. I have no desire to
emphasize it or to insist upon it, if only my
authority as mistress at The Oaks is properly
recognized. As your daughter, Father, I am
entitled to that dignity which you yourself
have been fond of insisting upon; and as your
daughter I intend to exercise the authority and
maintain the dignity of that position so long
as you permit me to hold it. When you cease
to permit that, I shall leave The Oaks and go
to my own plantation of Tye, which my
mother left me. You must remember that I
am a grown woman of twenty-one, and that
I am not a dependent upon anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Now, daughter," interrupted Colonel Conway
with affection, "you are talking nonsense.
You know that you are mistress of The Oaks,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That is quite all I am insisting upon. As
mistress of The Oaks I do not intend to have
my authority questioned or my affairs interfered
with by anybody. I'm sorry I have this
occasion to assert myself, but the circumstances
are not of my making."
</p>

<p>
"But what do you mean, you&mdash;you&mdash;you
ill-regulated girl,&mdash;in charging me with a
crime?" almost shrieked the elder woman as
she confronted her niece in an attitude that
suggested a desire to shake her. "What do
you mean? What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better let that phase of the affair
drop, Aunt Betsy," answered the girl with a
calm that additionally exasperated her aunt.
</p>

<p>
"No, I will not let it drop. You have uttered
an accusation that I cannot and will not
let pass. You must say what you meant by it."
</p>

<p>
"I will say it if you insist," answered Margaret,
still preserving her exasperating calm.
</p>

<p>
"I do insist. I will not rest under such an
accusation. Go on! Tell me what you meant."
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Margaret. "You remember
that five years ago an attempt was made to
open our mail bag in some political interest.
Father appealed to the Government for its
protection, and from that day to this it has
gone back and forth under a United States
mail lock. In tampering with its contents&mdash;in
abstracting from it letters addressed to me,
you&mdash;I don't like to put the matter into plain
words. Let me say instead that you violated
the law which renders the United States mail
sacred. I'm sorry I have had to call your
attention to such a matter, but you forced the
necessity upon me."
</p>

<p>
By this time it was necessary to summon
maids and get "Aunt Betsy" back to bed
again,&mdash;genuinely ill this time.
</p>

<p>
It was not until she was made as comfortable
as circumstances permitted, that Colonel
Conway and his daughter returned to the
library and resumed their conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Now, daughter," said the old soldier, "I
am ready to do anything to right this wrong&mdash;anything,
of course, that will not compromise
your aunt."
</p>

<p>
"Father," responded the girl with a world
of tenderness in her voice, "you ought not to
have anything to do in the matter. It is Aunt
Betsy who has wrought all the mischief. She
has deceived you; she has deceived me; she
has deceived Mr. Westover. It should be her
duty, not yours, to undo the wrong she has
done."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear daughter, how can she?
She is a woman."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, Father, and I know our Virginian
view of such things. But it is all
wrong. You men of Virginia have granted
to us women a license that ought not to be.
If one of us utters a slander, you hold yourselves
responsible for it even unto death. If
one of us lies&mdash;it isn't a ladylike term, I
know, but it is what I mean&mdash;if one of us
lies you hold yourselves bound to maintain the
lie and answer for it, even at the pistol's point.
You Virginia gentlemen insist upon only one
point of honor for women. So long as we
observe that, we may lie and cheat and slander
at will and you sustain us in it. It is all wrong.
If a woman does mischief, she should herself
atone for it. In this case it is Aunt Betsy who
has wrought the wrong and it is Aunt Betsy
who should undo it."
</p>

<p>
"But how can she, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"By going to Mr. Westover, or writing to
him, and saying frankly: 'I robbed the post
bag of your letters to Margaret and her letters
to you.' That is what a brave man would do.
Why should not a brave woman do the same?"
</p>

<p>
"But, daughter, your aunt is a lady and
excessively sensitive."
</p>

<p>
"She forgot to be a lady when she did this
infamous thing, and her sensitiveness is mainly
a pretence assumed to play upon your chivalry
and to deceive you and others. If she were
honest in mind, a real, genuine, conscientious
sensitiveness would prompt her to make precisely
the reparation I have suggested. As
she is utterly dishonest and dishonorable instead,
I quite understand that no force, moral
or physical, could ever compel her to an act
of reparation like that."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you are very hard upon your
poor old aunt."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, Father. Truth is as much an
obligation of women as of men. So is courage
of the moral sort. But it is idle to expect that
after generations in which you gentlemen of
Virginia have excused us from all obligations
except that of chastity. You have assumed
our protection, and you have met that obligation
bravely; but&mdash;well, I have thought much
on that subject, and what I have thought is of
no consequence. What are you going to do
by way of righting the wrong Aunt Betsy has
done, as you excuse her from the obligation of
herself righting it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll do anything you suggest&mdash;anything
that will not compromise your aunt. You see
I must protect her."
</p>

<p>
"I understand. The one who has wrought
the wrong must be spared the consequences.
The victims of it must bear them. I have nothing
whatever to suggest, Father."
</p>

<p>
And with that she advanced, kissed him
tenderly, said:
</p>

<p>
"Poor, dear old Dad!" and quietly left the
room.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Colonel Conway set himself
to satisfy his daughter's conscience and his
own by writing a letter to Boyd Westover.
Then it was that, after repeated failures, he
compromised with his conscience by writing
to Dr. Carley Farnsworth instead.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that under Dr. Carley Farnsworth's
instructions Millicent Danvers sent
Colonel Conway and Margaret to bed.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betsy" was already sleeping the
sleep of one who feels that she has adroitly
escaped uncomfortable consequences.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="chap31"></a>
XXXI
<br />
A SUNSET INTERVIEW
</h3>

<p>
The days were growing short, and so
when Jack Towns approached The
Oaks that afternoon, the sun was setting
and Millicent was watching it from a little
hilltop just beyond the orchard and perhaps
half a mile from the house.
</p>

<p>
Jack came upon her there and was fascinated
with the picture she presented. With her head
bare and her hair in some disorder as a result
of facing the west wind too fearlessly, she
wore upon her shoulders a voluminous mass
of fleecy knitted work known in those days as
a "nubia," or, by those who preferred good
English to very bad dog-Latin, a "cloud."
As he approached from the east he saw her
figure silhouetted against the glowing western
sky, and the grace of it fascinated him. It was
like a great picture&mdash;suggesting one of Turner's
interpretations of Venice, with an absorbing
human interest added to the glow and
glory of it.
</p>

<p>
For to Jack Towns the girl who turned to
greet him as he rode up was a very absorbing
human interest indeed. The hour he had
passed in converse with her on the day before,
had left him with a glamor upon him which
even his jaunty indifference to permanent impressions
could not dismiss. He had been
moved to make this special visit to The Oaks
by an irresistible desire to see more of a young
woman whose superiority of mind and character
was strongly impressed upon him, and
whose very peculiarities&mdash;mainly due to differences
of environment and education&mdash;were
strangely appealing to his imagination.
</p>

<p>
Upon approaching her there upon the little,
sun illumined hilltop, he dismounted, and, with
bridle rein over his arm, joined her in admiration
of the glowing sunset.
</p>

<p class="illustration">
<a id="img-374"></a>

<br />
<span class="smcap">He dismounted, and, with his bridle <br />
rein over his arm, joined her.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 373.</i>
</p>

<p>
After the first greetings were over she said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Mr. Towns, I think that is
where your chivalry comes from?" And as
she said it, she waved her hand toward the
horizon with its gold and purple, intermingled
with pinks and blues and exquisite greens that
the dyer's art has never matched.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she added without waiting to be
asked for an explanation, "that you Virginians
are inspired with gentleness and chivalry
by the quality of the climate in which you live,
and that your sunsets give color to your imaginings
of courage, optimism, and high endeavor."
</p>

<p>
"I doff my hat in acknowledgement of the
double compliment," he said, "to our climate
and to our manhood. But surely fine sunsets
are not our exclusive possession. You must
have such at the North?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes&mdash;not often. They are so rare
indeed that we make note of them and recall
them afterwards as pleasant memories."
</p>

<p>
"But isn't that because you live in a large
city where the vapors of industry cloud the
sky and shut out nature's displays?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not live in a large city, Mr. Towns,
except for the two or three worst months of
the year, and not always even then. I live on
the 'blue hills of Milton.' My father has a
country place there, and since he has grown
old enough to relax a little in his business enterprises,
we live there almost all the year
round. So you see I know our climate quite
irrespective of the factory chimneys and their
fumes. The sunset is dying out. I don't like
to see the death of beauty or grandeur or glory
of any kind. Let's turn our faces toward the
house."
</p>

<p>
As they turned Jack Towns in his own mind
formulated his impressions in this wise:
</p>

<p>
"Here is a young woman who can think for
herself and without any regard whatever for
the conventions of thought; she is inspired
with an appreciation of truth and beauty, which
is only another way of saying that she is a poet
in her soul&mdash;thank God she is not a poet in
the magazines, for that would be dreadful.
She has common sense, too, in an uncommon
abundance. Jack Towns, you are falling
in love in a way you never dreamed of before,
and the fact doesn't alarm you in the
least."
</p>

<p>
As his meditations kept him silent for a
longer time than is usual when youth and
beauty walk together in the gloaming, Millicent
was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you could know our 'blue hills of
Milton.' They have some attractions of their
own."
</p>

<p>
"They certainly have," he answered. "I
know them&mdash;at least in a small way."
</p>

<p>
"Why, how did that come about?" she
asked in surprise. "I understood you to say
you were never in Boston but once."
</p>

<p>
"'And that same is thrue for you,' as my
Irish office attendant would say. I was never
in Boston until a few weeks ago, when I went
thither to arrange some financial affairs for
a client of mine"&mdash;he did not mention Westover's
name. "I had some negotiations with
a banking firm there, and the head of the establishment
was exceedingly courteous to me. He
took me to his country place to spend the Sunday.
By a curious coincidence, his surname is
the same as yours&mdash;Danvers. He's the head
of the banking house of Danvers, Appleton and
Wentworth. I wonder if by any chance he's
a relative of yours. At any rate he deserves
to be. For a more courtly gentleman I have
never met. He's the sort of educated, refined,
polished, considerate person that only three
States in this Union produce, so far as I have
been able to observe."
</p>

<p>
"Which are the three States, please,&mdash;that
is to say, if you are free to designate
them?"
</p>

<p>
"Massachusetts, Virginia, and South Carolina.
Mind, I don't say that such gentlemen
are not found in other States. It is only that
those of them whom I have personally met have
happened to be sons of one or other of the
three States mentioned."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there is a reason for that," answered
Millicent.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he inquired in answer.
</p>

<p>
"They are the three oldest commonwealths,"
she answered, "and the three most conservative.
You have a saying here in Virginia&mdash;a
true saying, I think&mdash;that 'it takes three
generations to make a gentleman.' The three
States you have named have lived their own
lives for a good many more than three generations,
and so they have had time to make gentlemen.
Still&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not continue her sentence, till Towns
urged her to do so. Then she said:
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say that about the most
perfect gentleman I ever met was Jake Greenfield,
a Vermonter, without education beyond
what he called the 'rujimenteries,' whom I met
in the Rocky Mountains."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about him," implored Jack, saying
nothing of his own acquaintance with Jake,
who had been his companion and shrewd adviser
during his stay in the Rocky Mountains
in Boyd Westover's interest. "Tell me about
him."
</p>

<p>
"I will," she answered. "I am always
pleased to celebrate his virtues. Jake is ignorant,
unfamiliar with the ways of society, and
wholly unformed as to his manners, but he is
instinctively a gentleman. He habitually eats
with his knife&mdash;a dirk-like thing that he carries
in his belt. He has no hesitation about
sitting at table and picking his teeth with a
fork. It never occurs to him to apologize for
lighting his pipe at table or quitting the company
before the others have done. None of
the conventions of civilized life have dawned
upon his intelligence as matters worthy of attention.
When I knew him, if a single pie sat
before him he would carefully count noses and
divide it equally; but if the table were well
dotted with pies he would seize upon the one
nearest him and devour it from his hand without
enlisting the services of knife or fork in
aid of the process.
</p>

<p>
"I met him in the Rocky Mountains where
my father had some mining interests, and I
was a good deal distressed and disgusted by
his lack of manners until I came to know the
real man who lived under so rough an exterior."
</p>

<p>
"How did that come about? Tell me,
please," said Jack Towns as he handed his
companion up the two or three steps that led
to the porch.
</p>

<p>
"It was a rather thrilling experience," she
answered, "at least in its beginning. I was
only a girl then of eighteen or nineteen. I had
gone to the Rockies with my father for the
sake of 'roughing it,' as they say out there,
and enjoying the out-of-door life. I was in
the habit of riding alone, anywhere I pleased,
for the region was a wilderness and nobody
lived in it except a few surface miners. One
day I rode away till I came to a little stream,
a few inches deep, which was crossed by a ford.
The road to and from the stream had been cut
by nature or by man, through bluff banks,
twenty feet high. I crossed the stream,
scarcely wetting the fetlocks of my horse. I
rode up through the cut on the other side to
the high ground above, and thence on through
a delightfully wild region, until presently it
began to rain in that sudden and torrential
way that belongs to the Rocky Mountains. I
turned my horse about and trotted him somewhat
hurriedly toward the ford I had crossed.
When I got there I found the trickling little
brook swollen to a mountain torrent, but I
did not recognize the change as a matter of
consequence. I saw that the water had risen,
but to me that meant only that where I had had
to make my horse wade fetlock deep before, I
must make him wade knee deep now. I pushed
him into the stream and almost instantly he was
swept from his footing. The depth required
swimming, and the onrush of the waters was
so great that swimming across the stream was
impossible. The horse made a gallant struggle
to reach the other side within the roadway
space, but he was swept away down stream. I
was afloat on his back, imprisoned as it were
between two perpendicular bluffs that offered
no point of possible landing or rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Just as I fully realized my situation Jake
Greenfield, mounted upon a strong horse, appeared
on the bank above.
</p>

<p>
"'Hold on for your life!' he cried to me,
'an' I'll be with you in half a minute.' With
that he turned his horse's head and rode away
for thirty or forty paces. Then, suddenly turning
about, he rode straight toward the bluff,
digging spurs into his horse's flanks at every
step, and lashing his rumps with a black snake
whip by way of making sure that he should
not refuse the leap. A moment later there was
a splash and a struggle in the water. Jake
Greenfield's horse had leaped into the stream
from the bluff twenty feet or more above, with
Jake Greenfield on his back, and the two had
sunk beneath the flood within a few feet of me
as I clung to my horse.
</p>

<p>
"After a few moments both came to the surface,
and the snortings of the horse indicated
that his breathing capacity was impaired. By
way of sparing him Jake slipped off the saddle
and took hold of a stirrup strap as a towing
line. But his poor horse's powers were exhausted
and he could sustain himself no longer.
He gave up the struggle and sank beneath the
flood, a martyr to the duty he owed to his
master&mdash;man. Pardon me, I'm making a
long story of this, but the details interest me
so."
</p>

<p>
"They interest me, too," quickly responded
her companion. "You cannot narrate them in
too minute detail to please me. I could listen
all night to the story. Go on, please."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jake continued to swim until presently
he caught my horse's tail and used it as
a means of keeping up with me. Then he
said:
</p>

<p>
"'Turn him to the right! Keep close in
shore. There's a little break in the bluffs just
ahead, and may be we can make it! More to
the right! Closer in shore! There! There's
the break. Make him catch bottom there if
you can,' You see, Mr. Towns, every word
spoken at that time was burned into my memory,
and I recall every detail as vividly as if
the thing had happened yesterday, or even to-day.
</p>

<p>
"I succeeded in 'beaching' my horse at that
little break in the bank. It was literally like
beaching him, for no sooner had he taken
three or four steps through shoaling water
toward the land, than he lay down, utterly
exhausted."
</p>

<p>
Here the girl stopped in her narrative, as if
it had been done. Jack Towns had no mind
thus to lose the climax.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't told me yet in what way Jake
proved himself a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," she answered, "and it was
that that I set out to tell you. Somehow heroism
always appeals to me, and in telling you
of Jake's heroism I forgot the other end of
the story. I was soaked through, of course,
and chilled to the bone. So Jake took me by
the arm&mdash;he wanted to take me on his back
but I wouldn't let him&mdash;and hurried me to
one of his cabins. You see, as caretaker of
the mining lands, he had several cabins, scattered
about over them. He told me there was
a motherly old squaw there who would look
after me, but when we got there the squaw,
after the manner of her race, had wandered
away somewhere and was not likely to return.
Jake built a big fire in the cabin chimney, and
then went outside, telling me to 'shuck off
them soakin' clothes' and wrap myself up in
the quilts that covered the sole orderly bed in
the place. As I did so I bethought me of the
conventionalities, and when Jake came back to
cook my supper and dry my clothes, I protested
that I could not consent to stay there alone, and
without even a squaw to sustain my dignity.
I simply must go to my father, I said, and when
he objected that the mountain torrent lay between
and was by this time twenty-fold fiercer
in its fury than when I had dared it before, I
declared that it made no difference; that at all
hazards I must make my way to my father's
quarters that night. By way of making the
matter impersonal and in that way sparing his
feelings, I dwelt upon the anxiety my father
must feel for me. I think Jake understood my
real objection to the situation. Indeed I know
he did, for by way of reply he said:
</p>

<p>
"'Ef you only could rest quiet here an' not
worrit overmuch, I've been a-plannin' to go up
the mountain to where the stream don't 'mount
to nothin', an' cross it an' go down an' tell Mr.
Danvers as how you is safe an' sound nevertheless
of your bein' tired out an' chilly an' all
that. Ef you kin spare me, I'd like to do that.'
</p>

<p>
"Not at all realizing the fact that that torrent
had its beginning twenty miles away and
in mountains so precipitous that no man could
scale them, I gave eager consent to his proposal,
and after preparing such supper as he
could for me, the devoted fellow&mdash;no, the
chivalric gentleman, I mean&mdash;set forth in the
torrential rain. I learned afterwards that he
toiled up the stream for six miles, plunged into
it and the darkness, breasted his way across it
as it swept him down its resistless current, and
with difficulty effected a landing on the opposite
side four miles below his starting point.
Thence he trudged through the darkness and
the rain to my father's quarters, where rescue
parties were forming to hunt for me. That's
the story. Don't you agree with me that Jake's
a gentleman in the true sense of the word?"
</p>

<p>
"All that is what I should have expected of
Jake," answered the young man. "You see
I've just returned from that region, and during
my stay there I was closely associated with
him."
</p>

<p>
The girl uttered a little exclamation of astonishment;
then, with that perfect self-possession
which Jack Towns had found to be the
most fascinating thing about her, she added:
</p>

<p>
"Confidence deserves confidence in return,
and before you go," for Jack had risen and
the two were advancing toward his restless,
pawing horse, "it seems only fair to tell you
that what you have said of the Boston banker
who entertained you over Sunday has been
very gratifying to me, for the reason that the
gentleman concerned is my father, and the
house you found so hospitable is my home. I
sincerely hope you'll have other occasions to
visit us there."
</p>

<p>
Jack's instant thought was:
</p>

<p>
"I'll make the occasions, and I'll do it
pretty soon too," but he confined his speech to
the courtesies of the moment, and a minute
later he was riding at half speed toward Wanalah,
wondering if his absence had kept supper
waiting, and not caring in the least whether it
had done so or not.

<br />
WHAT HAPPENED AT FIGHTING CREEK
</h3>

<p>
In Virginia in the late fifties there was no
question of principle or policy or anything
else at issue between the Whig and Democratic
parties. Even in national politics there
was none. The Whigs were supposed to
represent tariff protection and internal improvements.
The Democrats stood for free
trade and sailors' rights, but neither the one nor
the other of these cries represented anything
vital, any policy that was pending.
</p>

<p>
In Virginia the instinct of self-preservation,
awakened by hostility at the North to the institution
of slavery, had stimulated both parties
to an intemperate, uncompromising, relentless
advocacy of slavery as a system right
in itself,&mdash;a thing that nobody really believed,&mdash;and
whenever Whig and Democrat met in
debate, the only question between them was
which could go to the greatest extreme in that
direction. There were the old antagonisms
between the two parties. They were still remembered
with bitterness, and men grew excited
and even violent in their discussion; but
nobody on either side could have said what they
meant, for the sufficient reason that they meant
just nothing at all. There was a new, Free
Soil party rapidly gaining strength at the
North, and by both Whigs and Democrats in
Virginia that party was regarded as the common
enemy, to be fought to the death. But
while waiting for that, the Whigs and Democrats
fought each other for precedence and
place.
</p>

<p>
Political speaking under such conditions was
apt to be uninteresting to others than the speakers,
unless it involved something of accidental
and unusual moment. If any speaker under
the excitement of perfervid oratory happened
to use terms which his adversary could construe
to be offensive to himself, there was instantly
awakened the interest that pertains to
a quarrel which may presently ripen into a duel
or a street fight.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of that kind occurred at Fighting
Creek on the day after Jack Towns's visit to
Millicent, but some other things occurred that
gave peculiar interest to the occasion. Carley
Farnsworth read from the platform the note in
which Colonel Conway pledged himself to the
support of Westover's nomination. That in
itself was a staggering blow to Webb's candidacy.
As Foggy, whose phrases were apt to
be picturesque, put the matter:
</p>

<p>
"It knocks the underpinnin' out of our campaign,
and it looks to me, Webb, as if it might
knock the stuffin' out'n you."
</p>

<p>
But staggering as the announcement was,
there was far worse to come.
</p>

<p>
When Sam Butler, the Democratic candidate
for Senator, had emptied his mind and mouth
of all the florid rhetorical phrases he had sat
up of nights to construct, he brought a matter
of practical political importance to the front.
</p>

<p>
"I have endeavored to show you, my fellow
citizens, that Democratic principles ought to
triumph in this election; but neither you nor
I can fail to see that there is no chance of that
in this senatorial district. After consultation
with my friends and political advisers, I have
decided that the issue lies solely between the
regular and the independent Whig candidates;
and as between these two I think no Democrat
can hesitate to choose Mr. Boyd Westover as
the fittest man to represent us. I therefore resign
my own candidacy in Mr. Westover's
behalf, and I urge all my friends, all loyal
Democrats in the district, to vote for him. I
have been moved to this decision by impulses
of patriotism and by a sense of duty to the district
and to my fellow citizens."
</p>

<p>
This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky,
and for a full minute the crowd stood paralyzed
with astonishment. Then Butler's most active
supporter&mdash;by prearrangement of course&mdash;leaped
to the platform and cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Friends, Democrats, patriots! It occurs to
me that our party in this county has named no
candidate for the lower house of the Legislature.
In order that the Democratic vote shall
not be completely unrecorded, I move that we
now name Samuel Butler, Esq., for that honorable
place. His candidacy for that will in no
way interfere with his self-sacrificing decision
to take himself out of the senatorial campaign.
I ask all Democrats here present to gather in
the prize barn across the road, to consider this
suggestion."
</p>

<p>
A "prize barn" was one in which there
were appliances for pressing leaf tobacco into
hogsheads.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later it was announced that the
late Democratic candidate for Senator had
been unanimously nominated for the House of
Delegates.
</p>

<p>
"Now I know," said Carley Farnsworth to
himself, "what Edgar Coffey's message from
Judy to Butler meant. It's the shrewdest bit
of play I ever heard of. By securing his withdrawal
from the senatorial contest, the Queen
of the Mountains has enormously swelled
Boyd's planter vote. And by way of accomplishing
that she has promised the mountain
vote to Butler for the lower office, and it will
elect him beyond a doubt. On the whole, I
reckon I won't explain the matter to Westover.
He's quixotic, and he knows nothing of
politics. But, by Jove, it was a master stroke
on Judy's part."
</p>

<p>
That night when Edgar Coffey made his
report to Judy, telling her of the adroit and
graceful way in which the program had been
carried out by Butler, her comment was:
</p>

<p>
"Some folks has more sense'n you'd think."
</p>

<p>
When he had told her of the confidence with
which Webb was reckoning upon the mountain
vote to offset the loss, she added:
</p>

<p>
"An' some folks ain't got the sense the law
allows 'em."
</p>

<p>
But if Webb had less political sense "than
the law allowed him," there were certain of his
followers who were better endowed. Foggy,
in particular, realized the situation, and, by
way of meeting it, summoned Webb and a
dozen or so of his immediate supporters to a
conference in the hostelry of a neighboring
county seat.
</p>

<p>
There Foggy laid down the law to the optimistic
candidate.
</p>

<p>
"These here two happenings," he said,
"mean trouble. All the swell Whig planters
who were holding back because of Colonel Conway's
stand will now vote for Westover, and
use their influence to make their overseers and
others do the same. Every Democrat in the
district will vote for him as a matter of course.
They want to beat the regular Whig nominee,
and now that they haven't a candidate of their
own, they'll vote for Westover. Now what
have we got to meet all this with?"
</p>

<p>
Webb suggested the mountain vote, and
Foggy instantly replied:
</p>

<p>
"So far as I can see, we ain't got no mortgage
on that, and if we are to carry it we've
got to go after it."
</p>

<p>
So they went on discussing the situation,
ending by ordering a vigorous campaign in the
mountains with Webb for leader and Judy
Peters as the Dominant Power to be approached
with negotiations.
</p>

<p>
When Jack Towns heard of this program,
he went to Carley Farnsworth in some alarm,
to suggest some counter move.
</p>

<p>
"I am conducting this campaign," answered
the little doctor, "and I am in confidential relations
with Judy. I'll tell you, Jack, but you
must keep the secret, that it was Judy herself
who conceived and planned and organized
Boyd's candidacy. She made one of the best
diagnoses I ever heard of in his case, and her
therapeutics is matchless. Let her alone. She
has made up her mind to elect Westover with
such a majority as shall be convincing even to
him, and she will do it you may be sure. If
she wants to see any of us she'll have Edgar
Coffey whisper a hint of her desire into our
ears. Until she does that we mustn't interfere.
She might resent it as a reflection on her skill
in political management. Now let me drop a
hint into your ear. I said just now that I was
managing this campaign. That was a vainglorious
boast. I didn't persuade Butler to retire
in Westover's favor, but somebody arranged
that. Have you any idea who it was?
And if at the end of the campaign Butler
should find himself elected to the lower house
of the Legislature by virtue of the entire mountain
vote added to the regular Democratic poll
down here, do you imagine for an instant that
the result would take him by surprise? Now
keep mum about all these things. I am only
making suggestions by way of preventing you
from making mistakes. Don't say a word to
Boyd about it."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap33"></a>
XXXIII
<br />
CONSPIRACIES
</h3>

<p>
Jack Towns was particularly pleased
with the reassurance that Farnsworth
gave him respecting the campaign. It set
him free. In his loyalty to Boyd Westover he
would have ridden all night and all day in aid
of his friend's election; but he greatly preferred
to go to Dr. Carver's and dance all
night with Millicent.
</p>

<p>
In fact he did very nearly that. He put his
name down on her card for every set that
wasn't taken in advance, and he danced all of
them but three or four which she elected to
"sit out." If she had been accompanied by a
chaperon, she would have had to restrict Mr.
Towns's allowance of sets, but chaperons were
not deemed necessary for well-bred young
women in Virginia. Such young women were
supposed to know how to behave properly, and
as for protection, was not the entire adult male
population ready and eager to render it upon
occasion?
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Jack Towns did not in fact secure
an undue proportion of Millicent's sets, for the
reason that all the young men in the company,
who managed to get possession of her card in
time, put their names on it, for one dance each.
She rigidly restricted them to one. Perhaps
she considered Jack. But she put no restriction
on Jack Towns in the matter, and Jack
was so ill-mannered in his infatuation that he
asked no other young woman for her card, except
in the case of Charlotte Deane. Charlotte
was no longer as young as she could have
wished, and she was distinctly not beautiful or
brilliant. So Jack, observing that there were
no throngs of young men about her, asked for
her card and put his name down for two
dances.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, he devoted his attention to Millicent
Danvers until everybody was set wondering
if at last Jack Towns had really and truly
fallen in love. The same question arose in
Jack's own mind, but he, at least, was able to
answer it. "Yes," he admitted to himself, "I
have had many fleeting fancies before, but none
that resembled this. I am determined to win
Millicent Danvers if devotion can accomplish
it. I never felt in that way before. Always I
have felt, that while one young woman pleased
me, there were others who might be equally
pleasing. I don't feel so now. It is Millicent
Danvers now, or nobody with me. I wonder
what she will think of my big, disorderly bachelor
establishment if she ever consents to be its
mistress? I'll wager something handsome that
she'll&mdash;well, it will be time enough to speculate
on that when I have won her. By the
way, she would say that differently&mdash;'when
I shall have won her.' Anyhow my present
task is to win her. If I do that she will take
care of the rest. And after all a bachelor establishment
isn't a home. Just think of the
difference between my big house, where everything
is in chaos, and that home of hers
among the blue hills of Milton."
</p>

<p>
So he went on, thinking, wondering, speculating,
so long as she was fulfilling an engagement
to dance with somebody else whom he
hated and held in unmerited contempt without
any assignable reason. And when his own
turn came and he danced with her, his fancies
floated before his eyes as a dream pervades the
mind, a dream that so rejoices as to make of
waking a calamity.
</p>

<p>
Millicent did well whatever she did at all.
In dancing with her, Jack felt that she simply
lifted herself half an inch or so from the floor
and floated about without again touching it.
It was a delight to dance with her, as every
young man who had enjoyed the experience
stood ready to testify, but Jack Towns rejoiced
even more in "sitting out" a set. For then,
with her arm in his he could promenade the
porches, or the pair could stroll out into the
grounds where common prudence and courtesy
required him frequently to readjust the wrappings
that protected her otherwise bare
arms and shoulders, or, better still, he could
seek out a secluded nook in the porch or elsewhere,
where they two might talk of things
that held interest for both of them in common.
</p>

<p>
It was during one of these confabs, when
they sat out two dances in succession, that
Jack Towns invited himself to Boston and to
Millicent's home in the blue hills of Milton.
It came about in this way. Jack was really
and earnestly in love, for the first time in his
life, and the impulse to tell Millicent so was
well nigh irresistible. But Jack was a Virginian,
and he recognized the right of a young
woman to be courted in her own home. He
restrained his impulse of speech, therefore, so
far as open avowals were concerned, but his
utterances, short of a declaration, were such
as to leave the young woman in no doubt as
to his attitude and purpose.
</p>

<p>
When she spoke of her prospective home-going,
he asked, a little eagerly perhaps, when
that was to occur. She answered:
</p>

<p>
"It must be very soon&mdash;as soon as I shall
have done a duty that rests upon me. I'm
sorry Mr. Boyd Westover isn't here to-night.
He told me, when I met him casually this
afternoon, that he was obliged to return to
Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he was," answered Jack Towns
in a peculiarly inscrutable tone that he adopted
upon occasion. "But why? Do you particularly
want to see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, not only particularly but peremptorily.
It is a part of the duty I have set myself.
I cannot go back to Boston till I do."
</p>

<p>
"I see," he answered. "If you like I'll
call at The Oaks and ask you to ride with me.
We can ride over to Wanalah, and I'll see to
it that he shall be there at the time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no, no! That would never do.
There are reasons which I cannot explain, if
you'll excuse me. I must meet Mr. Westover
casually, quite by accident as it were."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then," answered Jack, with all
the confidence he was accustomed to assume at
a court trial when his case was an uncertain
one. "I'll arrange the accident and create the
'casualty.' You have only to respond favorably
to the invitations you receive during the
next few days. I'll take care of the rest."
</p>

<p>
There was a certain masterful self-confidence
in his words and tone that was somehow exceedingly
pleasing to Millicent. She felt that
Jack Towns was a man of limitless resource,
a man accustomed to do things and to get
others to do things, a man to be leant upon
with confidence, and the feeling was altogether
comforting. The thought that floated vaguely
through her mind, though she shrank from
formulating it, was that if ever Jack Towns
should love a woman, that woman would be
exceedingly comfortable in the certainty that
his care of her would be always tenderly solicitous
in its impulse, aggressively masterful in
its manifestation, and measurelessly ingenious
in its devices of safety for her against every
ill. If she had permitted her thought to frame
itself, as she resolutely refused to do, it would
have been to the effect that he was a man into
whose arms the woman he loved might throw
herself in full assurance of a welcome and in
trustful confidence of all-loving, all-daring protection.
She did not let the thought formulate
itself, but it floated nebulously in her mind,
which was perhaps even more dangerous&mdash;if
indeed there was any danger involved.
</p>

<p>
In answer to his words she said:
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly very good. I'll leave
it to you to arrange for me, and as soon as I
know definitely that my duty is done, I shall
go back to Boston,&mdash;or at least as soon after
that as my brother can come down here to escort
me. You know the journey is a trying
one."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. But why trouble your
brother needlessly? I shall be obliged to go
to Boston sometime soon, and if you permit,
I shall be glad to be your escort."
</p>

<p>
Jack was not fibbing. It is true that he had
no business that required him to visit Boston,
and yet he really felt it necessary for him to
go thither. He had fully decided to ask Millicent
Danvers to become his wife, and he must
go to Boston for that.
</p>

<p>
Millicent was right in saying that the journey
was a trying one. In that infant age of
railroad service the trip from Richmond to
Boston involved eight or ten changes of cars,
some of them at midnight. There were no
sleeping cars, no parlor cars, no dining cars,
no buffet cars&mdash;nothing in fact but rattletrap
coaches, linked together with chains and pins
and controlled only by hand brakes. No car
ran through, or further than its own railway
terminus. The connections were never close,
and for the waiting times between there were
no accommodations other than those which an
open and often rain-drenched railway platform
afforded.
</p>

<p>
But there was the question of chaperonage
to be considered. Boston notions on that subject
were different from Virginia notions. In
Virginia it was held that a man in escort of a
woman was in honor bound to protect her not
only against all others but against himself as
well. He must not, under such circumstances,
permit his conversation even remotely to approach
the confines of courtship. He must
maintain, from beginning to end of the escorting,
the attitude of one performing a duty with
absolutely unemotional and impersonal temper.
The man escorting was supposed to be a gentleman
who would suffer no harm to come to
the woman under his escort, even if his life
should be the forfeit.
</p>

<p>
But Jack Towns understood the difference
between Northern and Southern manners in
that respect, and so, to his offer of escort, he
promptly added:
</p>

<p>
"My good old negro Mammy will go with
you, of course. She'll see that you have all
the comforts that are possible on such a trip."
</p>

<p>
"But if you take her to Massachusetts she
will be free, will she not?" asked Millicent.
</p>

<p>
"Free? Yes. She is free now to do as she
pleases, and she regulates me with the high
hand, just as she did when I was a baby. Why
she even dominates my dress. Not long ago
I came to breakfast with a blue cravat on, and
she made me change it on the ground that I
had a murder case to defend that day and she
thought black would be more appropriate.
When I get ready to go to the club in the afternoon,
she inspects me, and if any detail of my
costume fails to meet the exigent requirements
of her code, I have to make a change, no matter
how hurried I am. Oh, she's free. Why,
she took away the breakfast I had ordered
the cook to prepare for me the other day because
it included fried eggs, and she was persuaded
that fried eggs didn't agree with me.
She is absolute mistress in my establishment,
and every darkey there recognizes the fact.
Her authority is supreme; mine is utterly subordinate.
If I want any change made in the
household arrangements, I must appeal to her
to order it. Fortunately she always gives the
order because she still regards me as her
'precious chile,' for whom everything must be
done, and whose uttermost whim is to be gratified,
regardless of the convenience of other
folk, high or low."
</p>

<p>
"But she is a slave," answered Millicent,
"and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In a way, I suppose she is," he interrupted,
"but all the eloquence of all the orators of
Boston could not convince her that her condition
in life could be improved. She is absolute
mistress of an establishment and of the poor
fellow who owns it. She has everything that
her heart desires, everything that her imagination
can conjure up as a want. Her present
is provided for, and her old age is secure. I
don't know any device of freedom that can
match that."
</p>

<p>
"Neither do I," Millicent answered; "but
I cannot approve slavery as an institution. I
am prejudiced, perhaps, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am not prejudiced," he answered, "but
I thoroughly agree with your dislike of slavery
as an institution. All our great Virginians,
Thomas Jefferson, John Randolph, George
Wythe, Henry Clay, and the rest, have regarded
the institution as an inherited evil to
be got rid of in any way that might be practicable,
in any way that might give to the negroes
a chance to become self-supporting citizens.
Thomas Jefferson put the Virginian
thought into an apt phrase when he said that
in freeing the negroes we must not 'arm them
with freedom and a dagger.' He might have
added, as many Virginians have done in practice,
that we must arm them with a hoe and
a plow."
</p>

<p>
"I see," she said, "and history teaches us
that Virginia has done more for the restriction
of slavery than any other State. It was in her
cession of the Northwest territory that a clause
was written forever excluding slavery from
that region; and we cannot forget that in the
convention which framed the constitution, the
Virginia delegates fought vigorously for a provision
to stop the African slave trade in the
year 1800, and the New England delegates
fought to continue it for eight years longer.
I think these things are not understood, and
I think I sympathize with your Virginian resentment
of outside interference by people who
do not understand. At any rate I shall carry
back to Boston with me a very different impression
of your attitude from that which I
had before. I shall be honored to have you
for my escort, Mr. Towns, and delighted to
be coddled all the way home by your dear old
Mammy."
</p>

<p>
At that moment one of the young men who
had secured a place on Millicent's card came to
claim his dance, and the conversation was at
an end.
</p>

<p>
But Jack Towns had a problem to solve.
He had promised to bring Millicent and Westover
together without seeming intention, and
he did not know how he was to do it. Suddenly
a thought came to him, and, as he had
exhausted his claim upon Millicent's dancing
card, he took French leave, mounted his mare
and set off for Chinquapin Knob, whither
Carley Farnsworth had preceded him many
hours before. He arrived there about breakfast
time and entered at once into negotiations.
</p>

<p>
Carley Farnsworth, as Jack Towns knew,
was in close touch with Judy Peters; for these
two friends of Boyd Westover had many confidences
with respect to the campaign, of which
Westover himself knew nothing, and Towns
had learned all about Judy's attitude and initiative
in Boyd's campaign.
</p>

<p>
"Of course Boyd's election is secure," said
Jack, as he buttered a slice of the hot breakfast
bread; "and now that Butler has withdrawn
and Colonel Conway has endorsed his
candidacy, his support will include a large majority
of the vote down here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and that is what Judy and I have
been working for. Her influence in the mountains,
when she gets ready to give the word,
will settle the question of election. But Judy
is practising psychological therapeutics. She
wouldn't recognize the words, but they represent
the facts. Her sole interest in this thing
is to brace Boyd up by showing him that his
fellow men believe in him. To that end she
has planned to secure as heavy a vote for him
as possible down here among the planter people.
To that end she has held back all intimations
of her purpose in the mountains. To
that end she arranged with Butler to withdraw
from the senatorial contest and run for the
lower house instead. Of course you understand
that she means to elect him to that."
</p>

<p>
"No, does she?" asked Towns in astonishment.
"I hadn't thought of that. How
astonishing!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is only a conjecture of mine, but
it is what is going to happen. Judy always
pays her debts to the last cent. In this case,
by his own withdrawal Butler throws every
Democratic vote in the district to Boyd, and
you don't imagine, do you, that he did that
without prospect of a recompense? Of course
Judy negotiated it, and it is my conjecture that
the price she is to pay is the mountain vote
for Butler's election to the House of Delegates,
which, with the Democratic vote down here,
will elect him. Of course I know nothing
about the matter. It is only that I can see
through a millstone if there is a hole in it.
And besides I know Judy's ways. She doesn't
care a fig for this election except to make it
serve her purpose of setting Boyd up again
and making him feel that he is Westover of
Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
"I see," answered Jack; "and the old
woman would do anything in reason, I suppose,
to aid in the accomplishment of that
purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything in reason? Yes. And anything
out of reason too. What is it you have in
mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want Judy to give a frolic of some
kind, and I'll take Miss Danvers to it. Can
you arrange that?"
</p>

<p>
"Easily, if it is likely to benefit Boyd. But
I don't see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you don't. But I tell you it will
do more for his rejuvenation than would his
unanimous election to the Senate. Of course
he must be there, and so must Miss Danvers.
I will take care of the rest."
</p>

<p>
"What is it you're up to, Jack?" asked
Farnsworth in not unnatural curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not tell you, except that I want
Miss Danvers and Boyd Westover to meet
casually. Besides, Miss Danvers is an interested
and sympathetic student of Virginia life,
and I want to show her the mountain side
of it before she goes back to Boston. How
soon can you arrange the thing, Carley?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's see. Edgar Coffey, who is not
supposed to know me by sight or by name is
to be here to-night. He will see Judy tomorrow,
some time, and deliver my messages
about Butler's withdrawal and the rest of it.
Will next Saturday do for the party?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you can arrange it so soon."
</p>

<p>
"Judy does things promptly, when she is
minded to do them at all, and in this case she
is sure to be so minded. You may safely invite
Miss Danvers to be one of the guests at
next Saturday's frolic. Now you must go to
bed. You had a hard day yesterday, and made
a brilliant speech, and of course you danced
all night with Miss Danvers. Since then you
have ridden fifteen miles with a load on your
mind. It is time for you to take some rest.
The front room in the west wing is prepared
for you. Go!"
</p>

<br />
JUDY'S PLANS OF CAMPAIGN
</h3>

<p>
The events at Fighting Creek threw
Webb's political advisers into something
like panic. They realized that
Butler's withdrawal and Colonel Conway's
support of Westover's candidacy would give
Westover a majority vote in the piedmont section
of the district. If Webb was to win at
all, it must be by securing the mountain vote.
To that end they sent all their speakers into
the mountains, arranging that Webb himself
should speak there twice or thrice a day. He
was a plausible fellow, persuasive in his oratory
and capable of verbal acrobatics of a kind
likely to be attractive to simple minded audiences.
But chiefly, Webb's backers relied upon
negotiations with Judy Peters, whose control
over the mountain vote of her own county was
almost absolute, and whose influence over the
vote in other mountain parts of the district
was apt to be controlling if she saw fit to exercise
it, as in many cases she did not.
</p>

<p>
In the present campaign Judy had given no
sign. Apparently she was altogether indifferent.
If she should persist in that indifference,
then a vigorous speaking campaign might turn
the battle; but if she could be induced to take
an active interest in Webb's election, the result
would be secure.
</p>

<p>
So Webb and some of his most persuasive
lieutenants were set to "arouse Judy's interest."
They visited her immediately after the
Fighting Creek disaster, and told her of the
danger that impended. She entertained them
with glorified fried chicken, stewed shoat, salt
pork with cream gravy, apple butter, and limitless
apple jack, but she declined to commit
herself. To all their solicitations she replied
in carefully equivocal phrases that left them
pleased, encouraged, but by no means satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"The old gal's a-goin' back on us, it's my
belief," said Foggy when these results were
reported to him.
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly mistaken," Webb answered.
"I had a long, confidential talk with
her and I came away from the conference with
an unshakable conviction that she means to
throw her uttermost influence in my favor."
</p>

<p>
"Did she say so in plain words?" asked
Foggy.
</p>

<p>
"No, not precisely that, but she certainly
intended to give me that impression. You
don't know Judy, or you would understand.
She likes to keep one hanging on, as it were.
She never commits herself by definite promises.
Sometimes she doesn't let even her henchmen
know how they are going to vote until the
night before election. We can safely trust
ourselves in Judy's hands."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope you're right, but I'd feel a
good deal better," responded Foggy, "if we
had a definite promise."
</p>

<p>
No sooner was the visit of the Webb forces
over than Judy turned to Sapphira and said:
</p>

<p>
"Go an' hang my red petticoat on the
frontmost panel o' the fence, an' leave it
there."
</p>

<p>
"Is Edgar Coffey a-comin' long by here this
evenin'?" asked the girl who had rendered
this service on several former occasions.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too knowin', Sapphiry, an' don't
git yourself into a inquirin' frame o' mind.
That there red petticoat's enough fer you to
think about jest now."
</p>

<p>
About sunset Edgar Coffey came slouching
up the road, apparently intending to pass the
place without stopping, but when he saw the
red petticoat hanging over the top rail of the
fence he seemed suddenly to remember that he
wanted a drink of water from Judy's glacial
spring, with something to temper its coldness
perhaps. So he leaped the fence, and passing
around the house, toward the spring, confronted
Judy at her back door. Quite casually
she invited him in, and after her hospitable
habit she brought forth a decanter of apple
jack for his entertainment.
</p>

<p>
"Now drink sparin'-like, Edgar," she said,
"'cause you's got business to ten' to an' I
don't want none o' that confusion o' tongues
the Bible tells about. But mend your drink
an' git over your tired an' then I'll give you
your pinters."
</p>

<p>
Edgar Coffey was habitually a sober man.
That is to say he never drank liquor that he
must pay for; but when the tipple cost him
nothing he was apt to make up for lost time.
Judy, whose habit it was to know all about
the men she dealt with, knew this, and upon
occasion tempered her alcoholic hospitality
with prudent reserve. If she had had no mission
for Edgar Coffey to fulfil, he might have
emptied the bottle without interference on her
part. As it was, she withdrew the supply as
soon as he had filled his little tumbler for the
third time, and as soon as he had emptied it
again she addressed herself to the business in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"That there William Wilberforce Webb has
been here with his gang, to 'lectioneer me,"
she said. She would have used some opprobrious
epithet with Webb's name if she could
have thought of one that seemed to her more
scornful than the man's own cumbersome name
did.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I knowed they was a-comin'," answered
Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what you knowed. Listen to
me. You is to go an' git Morris Bryant an'
Lem Fulcher, an' Wyatt Fletcher an' two or
three others, an' 'tend his speakin' meetin's,
specially' them as don't lay close to here&mdash;them
as is held in the furder parts o' the mountings
where may be a word from me don't
count for as much as it does round here."
</p>

<p>
"Is we to raise a racket an' break up the
meetin's?"
</p>

<p>
"No. Yous is to be as meek as Moses, an'
ax questions, jest as ef you was doubtful like
an' a seekin' information. But you ain't to
ax William Wilberforce Webb none o' the
questions, 'cause he mout answer 'em an' spile
the game. 'Tain't answers we want, but effec's.
You is to ax everybody you see, what
that feller's wagon-load o' name means. An'
you's to wonder, jest curious like whar he got
it to tote round. An' then you can sort o'
explain your curiosity by sayin' you's heard
somewhere's as how William Wilberforce is
one o' the biggest abolitionists, an' wonder
whether Webb is his nephew or his son, an' if
Webb ain't maybe a abolitionist in disguise,
a tryin' to git into the Legislatur. Ef anybody
answers your questions an' tries to explain,
you can jest say, 'Well, I dunno nothin'
'bout it, only it looks sort o' 'spicious like,' an'
go away an' hunt up another crowd. You
know how to do a sneakin' thing like that,
Edgar, better'n anybody I ever seen, an' the
men I's named fer your feller sinners ain't no
slouches at that sort o' thing nuther. You's
got no call to argify or say anything as anybody
can pick up. You-all's business is jest
to ax questions, raise suspicions an' make impressions."
</p>

<p>
She chuckled as Edgar winked at her in
token of complete comprehension, and as she
did so she muttered:
</p>

<p>
"That feller's name'll be the death of him
yit."
</p>

<p>
Then she added:
</p>

<p>
"Now you can have another pull at the apple
jack, Edgar, an' then you must be off, fer
they's a big Webb gatherin' 'pinted fer to-morrer
over at Olivet church, an' I want all
you fellers to be thar."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute, Judy," said the hulking
mountaineer as he unlimbered his legs and sat
upright in his chair. "I's got a message fer
you from Dr. Carley Farnsworth."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell me that fust off?"
asked Judy almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
"'Cause 'twouldn't 'a' been polite, like, tell
you was done speakin'. 'Ladies fust' is my
motto."
</p>

<p>
"All right. Limber up your tongue an' tell
me what 'tis."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he says he'll cover all expenses, but
you is to give a very select&mdash;them was his
words&mdash;a <i>very select</i> Brunswick Stew here
next Saturday an' let him bring up a wagon-load
o' folks from down below. He says it'll
do more'n the 'lection itself for Westover in
the way you an' him is a-thinkin' of. I didn't
ax him what he meant by that, 'cause he
seemed to think you'd know all about it. Oh,
he said you must be sure to send a partic'lar
invite to Westover. He's to speak over at
Cob Station Friday."
</p>

<p>
Judy received the message placidly, and,
without comment upon it, hurried Edgar Coffey
away on his mission.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said to herself presently,
"Carley Farnsworth ain't no fool; but I'd
give somethin' purty to know how he expects
me to make a Brunswick Stew this late in the
fall when they ain't a tomato or a ear o' green
corn left alive in all the land."
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly she called for her three
sons, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and Theonidas,
who happened to be at home at the
time.
</p>

<p>
"We's a goin' to give a barbecue nex' Saturday,
right out in the patch o' red oak an'
black gum woods. So you's got to git to work.
Kill an' dress a shoat an' two lambs an' 'bout
a dozen chickens, an' hang 'em in the spring
house to cool. Then you three haul out the
lumber from the corn crib an' knock up a lot
o' tables. No, Daniel Webster an' Henry Clay
can ten' to that, while Theonidas digs the
roastin' pits an' chops some oak an' hickory
wood to roast with. Chop it short, Theonidas,
an' split it fine, so's it'll go to coals quick."
</p>

<p>
After she had given these orders and instructed
Sapphira as to duties that must devolve
on her, she busied her mind with other
things relating to the affair. First of all she
filled and lighted her pipe and sat down in a
big rocking chair to "do a little studyin'."
</p>

<p>
"Very select," she mused. "That means
I mustn't let the fellers drink too much. I can
ten' to that, so they ain't no bother. He's a
goin' to bring a lot o' stuck-ups with him.
That's all right, an' I'll make 'em think we's
purty nigh on to bein' sort o' civilized ourselves.
Le's see; Burch Wrigley an' Lewis
Vance an' Jim Woodson won't do. They'd
go round chawin' meat an' a holdin' it in their
han's what hain't been washed sence Noah's
flood cleaned things up, like. Them fellers
ain't to have no invites. I'll send 'em a feed
in a bucket instid.
</p>

<p>
"Le' me see! Jim Wood's a-goin' down
to the speakin' at Cob Station, Friday. I'll
tell him to tell Boyd to come up here Friday
night. Then I'll have him on the ground fer
Saturday. Oh say, Judy, I'll send a invite to
William Wilberforce Webb! It'll be good fun
to see him when he fin's out what sort o' party
I's got, an' oh Jemimy! When he fin's Boyd
here! An' jes' ten days 'fore the 'lection too!
It'll be fun all over the woods!"
</p>

<p>
And Judy was so pleased with her little device
for amusement that she chuckled over it
for full ten minutes afterward. She wound up
her chuckling with the exclamation:
</p>

<p>
"William Wilberforce Webb! Blue lightning
what a name! By the time Edgar Coffey
an' them fellers is through with him he'll wish
he'd boxed up that name an' put it in his
cellar 'fore ever he come up into the mountings.
An' I'll string out the whole o' that
name every time I speak to him on Saturday."
</p>

<p>
Having thus settled upon her arrangements
and set them going, Judy turned her meditations
into another channel.
</p>

<p>
"Of course Carley Farnsworth knows what
he's about, but I don't. May be I can figger
it out, though. He sent word as how this thing
would do more good to Boyd than the 'lection
itself. I reckon it somehow tetches on his
trouble with that gal what's been a preyin' on
his mind. I reckon that's it, an' Carley sees
how to make it patch things up like. Course
that's it. They wouldn't be no sense in it ef
that wasn't the meanin'. All right. Ef we
can straighten things out, twix' Boyd an' the
gal, they won't be no more trouble o' no sort
'bout him. They ain't never no cause to worry
'bout a feller that's got a big office an' a little
gal all to wunst, I reckon."
</p>

A MOUNTAIN TOP REVELATION
</h3>

<p>
The barbecue at Judy's was successful
in every way. Jack Towns and Carley
Farnsworth took two crowded
wagon-loads of young women up the mountain,
starting early in the morning, and there were a
dozen or twenty young men on horseback
to complete the piedmont contingent. Boyd
Westover was already at Judy's, and the Queen
had summoned all the presentable mountain
folk, male and female, to the feast and frolic.
</p>

<p>
Millicent had begged Margaret to go, but
there were conclusive reasons why she should
not, some of which she mentioned in excuse
and some of which she forbore to mention.
Her aunt was really ill, as a result of shock.
Her father was by no means well. She herself
was in distress, and above and beyond all,
she did not wish to meet Boyd Westover. She
could conceive of nothing more embarrassing
than a meeting with him under the circumstances.
She did not say so to Millicent, but
Millicent understood, and Millicent had plans
of her own, in aid of which, as Jack Towns
had clearly set forth, to her, this expedition
had been organized.
</p>

<p>
Another absentee, whose absence Judy resented
rather angrily and vituperatively, because
his absence robbed her of anticipated fun,
was William Wilberforce Webb. He was on
his way to Judy's when he learned that Boyd
Westover was there. Then suddenly he remembered
some engagement that took him in
a different direction and far away from the
festivity. He sent an elaborately apologetic
and rhetorically grandiloquent letter of apology,
which Judy did not read further than the
opening sentences that announced his inability
to be present.
</p>

<p>
Having dug so much of meaning out of the
rubbish of words in which it was hidden, she
muttered:
</p>

<p>
"The durned coward!" and cast the letter
into the fire.
</p>

<p>
But there was fun enough and to spare.
The mountaineers understood that this was a
show, that they were the performers and that
the guests from the piedmont region were the
audience. They put forth their utmost endeavors
to entertain, and they were abundantly
successful. Their contests of strength and
agility, their exhibitions of skill with the rifle,
in throwing "rocks" at a minute mark, and
in other ways, won a degree of applause that
might have satisfied even the morbid desires
of an opera company.
</p>

<p>
Millicent was standing by Westover's side,
talking of indifferent things, when some change
of program in the athletics created an unannounced
intermission. She seized upon the
occasion for the accomplishment of the purpose
that had brought her thither.
</p>

<p>
"There must be a grand view," she suggested,
"from the top of that rock up there."
</p>

<p>
"There is," he answered, "and I'd like you
to enjoy it. Will you mind walking&mdash;or perhaps
I should say climbing&mdash;up there?"
</p>

<p>
She responded gladly and the two set off.
The climb was not an easy one, and it was
quite half an hour before they reached the summit.
When they arrived there Westover led
his companion to the best points of observation,
but he was disappointed to find that her
enthusiasm was less than he had hoped.
</p>

<p>
"You don't care much for the views after
all," he ventured to say, half reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do. Or rather, I should enjoy them
intensely, if it were not that I have something
on my mind, something that it is my duty to
do and that I fear I shall go wrong in doing.
It was for that that I came up here with you,
Mr. Westover, in order that I might talk with
you apart from the crowd down there."
</p>

<p>
She paused timorously, and nervously
stripped the glove she had unconsciously removed
from her hand. By way of encouragement,
Boyd Westover said:
</p>

<p>
"Go on. I shall be glad to hear anything
you have to tell me."
</p>

<p>
She remained meditatively silent for half a
minute more. Then she asked, with great,
open, honest eyes looking into his:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Westover, can you, do you believe a
woman&mdash;in the same way that you take a
man's word, I mean? If Mr. Towns, or Dr.
Farnsworth, should solemnly assure you of the
perfect truth of anything they might have to
say to you, you would believe him as implicitly
as if his statement were a fact within your personal
knowledge. Can you believe a woman's
solemn assurance in the same way and to the
same extent?"
</p>

<p>
"When you are the woman making the
statement, yes!" he answered gallantly, but
with an assurance of sincerity in his voice, and
with a still more emphatic assurance of sincerity
in the eyes that looked straight into hers.
"I shall believe anything you tell me as firmly
as I believe in my own existence, or in the
stability of the rocks under our feet."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you sincerely," she said, with that
Bostonian fulness of expression that had peculiarly
charmed all the Virginians who had
enjoyed a meeting with her. "Now I'll make
the statement that you are to believe as absolutely
true."
</p>

<p>
She paused, as if framing her utterance carefully.
After a moment she said:
</p>

<p>
"In what I am going to say to you, and in
seeking this opportunity to say it, I do not
represent anybody but myself. Especially I
do not represent Margaret Conway."
</p>

<p>
He started a little at the name, and she observed
the fact, but she went on, not heeding it.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed in telling you what I am going to
tell you, I am violating Margaret's earnest and
express commands. Perhaps I am even violating
a confidence of friendship. I don't
know, and it makes no difference. It is my
duty to tell you, and I'll do that duty at all
hazards. It involves the life-long happiness
or unhappiness of two persons whom I hold in
affectionate regard."
</p>

<p>
By this time Westover, nervous, restless,
troubled and enthusiastic as he was, was
wrought up to the verge of delirium.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me!" he cried earnestly. "Tell me
quickly! I can endure the suspense no longer."
</p>

<p>
In reply the girl, who had completely recovered
her self-control, said very deliberately:
</p>

<p>
"What I have to tell you may perhaps explain
many things that you have not hitherto
understood. It is this: the letters you wrote
to Margaret Conway at the time of your
trouble were never delivered to her; the letters
she wrote to you at that time were never
posted. That is all."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?" he asked, seizing
her by the shoulders as if intent upon shaking
the answer out of her. "Do you <i>know</i>
it or is it only conjecture? Tell me, quick,
how do you know it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have seen the letters," she answered,
calmly enjoying his half-mad excitement.
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know mine were not received
and hers not mailed?"
</p>

<p>
"I have seen them," she answered. "Yours
were not opened and Margaret had never seen
them. Hers were addressed and stamped, but
bore no postmarks. Be perfectly sure, Mr.
Westover, that I know all I say."
</p>

<p>
"But who interfered? Why were the letters
stopped in transit?" he asked almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
"That I am not free to tell you. I am concerned
only for you and Margaret. The rest
concerns another person, and I have no
right&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Was it Colonel Conway? Did he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Westover, you know Colonel Conway.
Therefore you know it was not he, just as you
know that he isn't a coward or anything else
dishonorable. Now please don't ask me any
further questions. I have already violated obligations,
I suppose. At any rate I have put
you in possession of the essential facts. The
rest lies with you. We must go down the hill
now."
</p>

<p>
The two started off together, but before they
had journeyed far, Westover stopped suddenly
and, taking both the girl's hands in his, said
fervently:
</p>

<p>
"I thank God, and I thank you, Millicent
Danvers. To the end of my life I shall thank
you. Now let us be off, for I must get away
from here."
</p>

<p>
She did not ask him why, but she understood
and approved.
</p>

<br />
THE MEETING AT THE OAKS
</h3>

<p>
As the two neared the scene of Judy's
festivities, Millicent suddenly stopped
and, looking straight into Westover's
eyes, asked:
</p>

<p>
"You are very sure you believe me, and that
I have acted upon the prompting of conscience
alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Millicent Danvers, I never believed anything
in my life more confidently than I do
that."
</p>

<p>
"And do you think I have done right?"
</p>

<p>
"Right? Yes. You have saved two lives
from wreck and wretchedness. Could anything
be righter than that? You have a sensitive
conscience; bid it rest easy in the consciousness
of a brave deed well done. Charles
Kingsley says: 'God gives it to few men to
carry a line to a stranded ship.' That is what
God has given it to you to do. Be sure I shall
not compromise you in any way, and may God
always bless you!"
</p>

<p>
Both were too much overwrought to indulge
in further speech. They hurried on to the
house, and Boyd went instantly to Judy, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to miss the rest of the frolic and
especially the evening dance; but I find I must
leave immediately."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Boyd, ef it's becase o' the
gal," answered Judy with womanly sympathy.
"Jest set still here fer five minutes an' I'll have
Theonidas bring your horse round to the road
back o' the house, so's nobody'll see you a settin'
off. Say, Boyd, that Boston gal's awful
nice. I wish 'twas her."
</p>

<p>
"Let Jack Towns dance with her to-night,
Judy, and you'll be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Westover was in the saddle
and hurrying down the mountain as rapidly
as his concern for the welfare and the
bones of Rob Roy would permit. That enthusiastic
quadruped had an unconquerable preference
for the faster gaits familiar to horse
flesh, and, if left to himself, he would have
gone at a gallop all the way down the mountain.
But his master, with a discretion superior
to his, restrained him, permitting only a
trot on the levels and compelling what the
horse evidently regarded as an absurd walk
down the steeper inclines.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all restraints the good horse carried
him over the twenty-mile distance in little
more than two hours' time, and it was at
the gloaming time that he approached The
Oaks.
</p>

<p>
He had formed no plans when he rode away
from Judy Peters's place. His first thought
as he went down the mountain was that he
would go to Wanalah, write a letter to Margaret,
enclose it in a note to Colonel Conway
and send it by a special messenger. He abandoned
that program promptly, and after framing
and rejecting several others of less elaborate
formality, he resolved to go straight to
Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"I have a right to do that," he said to himself.
"Now that I know what her attitude has
been it is not only my privilege but my duty
to deal directly with her, to tell her what I
have learned, to tell her of the misapprehension
I have labored under, to renew my suit
and to learn from her lips what her present
feeling is. I know that, already, but it will be
reassuring to have her tell me of it. God bless
that Boston girl and her New England conscience
and her courage! For it required courage
of a high order to do what she did. Not
many people would have dared do it."
</p>

<p>
So thinking he rode into the house grounds
at The Oaks while the last glow of daylight
was fading out of the sunset side of the sky.
</p>

<p>
Seeing a young negro, he dismounted and
tossed the rein to the boy, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Don't stable him; just walk him back and
forth till he cools down and then hitch him
somewhere handy; I shall ride again presently."
</p>

<p>
Walking rapidly up the path he stepped upon
the porch, and there met Margaret face to face
for the first time since he had gaily bidden her
adieu at midsummer.
</p>

<p>
"Margaret!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Boyd!" she answered, and a moment later
he had taken her in his arms and caressed her
fervently.
</p>

<br />
<span class="smcap">"Margaret!" . . . "Boyd!"</span>&mdash;<i>Page 436.</i>
</p>

<p>
"You have come at last!" she said as she
withdrew herself from his embrace.
</p>

<p>
"At last?" he asked in answer. "It was
only two hours ago that I learned that I might
come at all. I was twenty miles away then,
and I am here now, here to claim fulfilment
of the most glorious promise a woman ever
made to a man&mdash;here to claim you, Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"I know," she answered, as they sank into
porch chairs. "Don't let us waste time in
explanations, now that they are so utterly unnecessary.
Just let us be happy."
</p>

<p>
The conversation thus begun lasted until
near supper time. It is not necessary to report
it for the information of any who have
been lovers, and as for the rest, they would
never understand.
</p>

<p>
Just before the late supper time Westover
suddenly awakened to his duty.
</p>

<p>
"I must see your father," he said. "Without
his permission I have no right to consider
myself a guest in his house."
</p>

<p>
Margaret, knowing her father's perplexed
eagerness to see Westover and be reconciled
with him, smiled as she answered:
</p>

<p>
"I'll send for Father."
</p>

<p>
She did so, and presently the old Colonel
came limping into the porch. As he approached,
Margaret slipped into the house,
leaving the two men alone.
</p>

<p>
They greeted each other with a cordiality
that rendered all explanations and apologies
needless, but Colonel Conway insisted upon
explaining and apologizing.
</p>

<p>
"I've been a coward, Boyd! I've been an
abject coward."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know any other man living who
would dare say that, Colonel."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not. No, I suppose not. Still
it is true, and I'm profoundly ashamed of it."
</p>

<p>
"Now my dear Colonel Conway," interjected
Westover, "let us not talk of that.
This is the happiest hour of my life and, I
hope, of Margaret's. Let us not spoil it by
discussing disagreeable things which are completely
past and gone."
</p>

<p>
"But there are some things that I must
explain, Boyd, and you must listen to me. I
ought to have gone to you in Richmond at
the time of your trouble. I didn't, because
I was forbidden to do so by an authority which
I was cowardly enough to yield to. Margaret&mdash;great
woman that she is&mdash;told me then
I was a coward, and she was right. When
you came back to Wanalah my purpose was
to go to you at once, but the same authority
forbade, giving me a sufficient reason in the
fact that you had written no line to Margaret.
I know better now, but only within
the past few days. Under that mistaken belief
I refused to join in your nomination. A
few days ago a catastrophe here revealed the
truth to both Margaret and me. She appealed
to me to do what my sense of honor might
suggest. That meant that I should go to you
at once, grasp your hand, tell you of the misapprehension
and of the facts that removed
it, and ask your pardon. No, don't interrupt.
You are generously disposed to spare me, but
I shall not consent to be spared. My first
impulse was to do what Margaret expected
of me. But an appeal was made to me to
spare another&mdash;the culprit in the case&mdash;and
I weakly yielded to it. I compromised with
my conscience and my honor. I wrote to Dr.
Farnsworth the letter you have doubtless seen,
and I did no more. It was all cowardice,
and I am heartily ashamed of it. Will you
forgive me, Boyd?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Conway," answered Boyd with
intense earnestness, "no man with a cowardly
nerve in his body could ever have made the
manly self-accusing apology you have offered
to me. You grievously wrong yourself. It
was not cowardice that restrained you, but a
tender and generous consideration for a helpless
person who was entitled to every protection
you could give her. Now let us talk
no more of this! Let us never refer to it!
Let it be a dead thing of a dead past&mdash;a thing
done with, forgotten, banished forever from
our minds!"
</p>

<p>
"You are very generous," answered the
now feeble old man. "But that is not a thing
to be wondered at. You are Westover of
Wanalah, and for nearly two hundred years
that name has stood for all there is of gentle,
generous and courageous manhood. You'll
stay to supper of course?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Colonel. I have much to do to-night.
I must ride at once&mdash;as soon as I shall have
said 'good night' to Margaret."
</p>

<p>
It took a considerable time for the saying
of that good night.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be over here at ten o'clock to-morrow
morning, Margaret," he said, "and we'll go
for a ride. I'll have a servant bring over a
young filly I have in my stables, that you'll
be delighted to ride. She's spirited, but as
gentle as a zephyr&mdash;that's what I've named
her&mdash;'Zephyr'&mdash;and her paces are perfect.
She's to be yours from this time forth. I personally
educated her for you last summer,
before&mdash;before the trouble came."
</p>

<p>
"But to-morrow is Sunday; aren't we to
go to church?"
</p>

<p>
"No. We are going to Wanalah, so that
you may look over the place and see what alterations
are needed. I must tell you, Margaret,
that an investment,&mdash;very wise or very lucky,
I don't know which,&mdash;made by my father in
my name, has suddenly borne fruit, making
me, Jack Towns says&mdash;and he has charge of
the business&mdash;three times over the richest
man in Virginia. The wealth is of no consequence
in itself, but I mention it so that in
deciding what shall be done at Wanalah you
need have no fear of expense before your
eyes."
</p>

<p>
"But church is at Round Hill, to-morrow,
almost under our noses. If we don't attend,
what will people say?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang 'people.' We are 'people' now.
We're happy and we're going to stay happy.
And after all what can they say? They'll say
that Boyd Westover and Margaret Conway
are very much in love with each other, and
we don't care to contradict that, do we?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Neither do I. So let them say on. They'll
wonder when it is to be, and I'm wondering
about that myself now. When is it to be,
Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know. Of course I must have time
to make a trousseau."
</p>

<p>
"What for?" he asked. "Hang the trousseau,
or make it after we're married. What's
the difference? You've plenty of clothes, and
you're charming in any of them."
</p>

<p>
"But Boyd, dear,&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But Margaret dear," he interrupted, "you
see our marriage was to have occurred in the
late summer or early fall. It has already been
unreasonably delayed. It is nonsense to delay
it further. Think a little, and think quick, and
name a day."
</p>

<p>
"If you must have it so, I suppose it must
be so. You are the Master now. And besides&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not finish her sentence till he challenged
it, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Besides what, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"I was only thinking," she answered, "that
I can't persuade Millicent to stay much longer,
and I do want her to be my first bridesmaid.
You see, Boyd, it isn't only that I'm very fond
of her&mdash;I am <i>very grateful to her</i>."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," he answered with emphasis, but
neither the one nor the other said aught of the
occasion for gratitude. They both understood.
But he eagerly grasped at the helping
hand:
</p>

<p>
"Then you <i>must</i> name a very early day,
or she will have flitted."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see," she said; "the election will
occur one week from next Tuesday; that
is ten days hence. Our wedding shall occur
on the day after you are elected Senator."
</p>

<p>
"But suppose I should not be elected?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case the day will come round just
the same," she said; "but you will be elected.
I have Dr. Farnsworth's positive assurance
that you will be elected by the largest majority
any candidate ever received in this district,
and Dr. Farnsworth is a man who deals
exclusively in facts, never in conjectures."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have concerned yourself about
my election?"
</p>

<p>
"How could it be otherwise? As I told
you in the long ago, Boyd, I am not a woman
who loves lightly or lightly forgets."
</p>

<p>
"I know," he answered. "Your father is
taking his supper alone. Go to him at once.
I'll mount and away."
</p>

<br />
THE OLD CLOCK TICKS AGAIN
</h3>

<p>
"It's a rambling old place," Westover
said, as he and Margaret strolled
through the vast spaces of the Wanalah
rooms with their highly polished white ash
floors, their wealth of stoutly built, time darkened
furniture, their ancient, oaken wainscots
and their hospitably spacious fireplaces. "I
suppose a modern judgment would say tear
it down and build anew&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then the modern judgment shall have no
welcome when I am mistress here. Tear down
Wanalah, with its walls of thick masonry, its
generously large rooms, and its memories?
Only a vandal would do that. I'll tell you,
Boyd, there is only one change I'd like you
to make here."
</p>

<p>
"I'll make it. What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"There's a beautiful old standing clock in
the dining room that has never ticked since I
have known Wanalah. Won't you have somebody
put new works into it and set it going
again?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, "but it shall not run
until you and I return from our wedding trip
and you enter the house as its mistress. We'll
go to it together then and set it going, to mark
time in a new era at Wanalah."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good and thoughtful and
tender, Boyd. I suppose you are a trifle romantic
also, but I shall certainly not quarrel
with that, now or ever."
</p>

<p>
"Speaking of our wedding trip, Margaret,"
he said eagerly, "what is it to be? We can
go anywhere you like and everywhere you like
and for as long as you like."
</p>

<p>
"Am I really free to choose?" she asked,
looking into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, really and absolutely."
</p>

<p>
"What I would like best, then, would be
to go up to that place of yours in the high
mountains. It was there that you suffered
most on my account; I want you to rejoice
and be happy there, Boyd, by way of recompense."
</p>

<p>
"But it's rough living up there, Margaret;
perhaps you'd find it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'd find it delightful. How could it be
otherwise, with just you and me there?"
</p>

<p>
"It shall be so then. Nothing could delight
me more. I'll get Theonidas to carry
my things back up there at once. They are
still at Judy's. And we'll take along with us
whatever baggage you want."
</p>

<p>
"That will be very little. It is the air, the
sunshine, the rain, the freedom and <i>you</i>, Boyd,
that I want. And besides, you know you have
forbidden me to have a trousseau. I'll be a
wood nymph or a water witch or something
of that sort, and such beings do not bother
with baggage, I suppose."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the next week, Westover was speaking
day and night, all over the district. He
really cared nothing for the office he was running
for, but it was his temperament to do his
mightiest to win in any contest in which he
had a part, and in this case he had the additional
impulse to gratify Margaret by securing
the biggest majority possible for his election.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in his enthusiasm, Colonel Conway
forgot all about his gout, and busied himself
in the fulfilment of the promise he had
long ago given, to fill The Oaks at the wedding
time with the most brilliant company the
country could furnish, and to have feasting
there of a kind that might make the occasion
memorable. He even made a journey to
Washington and fairly forced his old commander
in the Mexican War, General Scott, to
be a guest, honored and honoring the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Judy Peters was also an honored guest.
When Westover learned at last what part she
had borne in his nomination and in his campaign,
he rode all the way up to her place to
persuade her to come. And when the time
arrived, he sent the Wanalah carriage to fetch
her. She appeared at the ceremony, in a gown
more gaudily gorgeous than any that had been
seen in that region since "the time whereof
the memory of man runneth not to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Conway devoted his particular attention
to her. Among other special courtesies
he shared with her a bottle of precious
old Madeira&mdash;too precious, as he told her,
to be "wasted on a lot of young fellows whose
palates are not educated up to it."
</p>

<p>
She drank the wine with relish, and after
the third thimbleful glass she gave judgment.
</p>

<p>
"It's better 'n apple jack, but in the matter
o' taste, 'tain't quite up to peach an' honey,
is it now, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
Since his boyhood nobody had ever ventured
to address Colonel Conway as "Bob,"
but as it came from Judy's barbaric and privileged
lips, he rather liked it.
</p>

<p>
The wedding was held in the early morning
because Boyd Westover had explained,
without a hint of whither they were bound,
that he and Margaret had a long journey to
make before nightfall.
</p>

<p>
The wedding morn was on the day following
the election, and the returns were all in.
Carley Farnsworth summarized them to the
company by announcing that Westover was
elected by the vote of more than three-fourths
and nearly four-fifths of the citizens of the
district.
</p>

<p>
Then he added:
</p>

<p>
"And Sam Butler, Democrat, is elected to
the House of Delegates, chiefly by the mountain
vote, which seems to have been pretty
nearly solid for him."
</p>

<p>
Judy Peters beamed upon Colonel Conway,
and ventured the remark:
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't no use a-votin', Colonel, ef you
don't stick together an' vote to 'lect. That's
our way up in the mountings."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Judy," the Colonel replied, "I'm
afraid you're a sad sinner. I'm afraid you
manipulated that vote."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't close acquainted with that big word
o' your'n, Bob, but I was purty nigh right in
my jedgment as to how this here 'lection was
a goin' to come out. Say, Bob, what d'you
think that there comb-cut rooster William
Wilberforce Webb thinks of hisself by now?
I wonder ef he'll unload some o' that name?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Westover and his bride left as soon as the
ceremony was over, but Colonel Conway kept
the festivities going all day, and there was
a dance at night.
</p>

<p>
The occasion was rich in opportunities for
Jack Towns, and, with the alert energy which
was characteristic of him, he made the most
of them. When, two days later, he left for
Boston as Millicent's escort, there was no
room for doubt in anybody's mind as to the
outcome of his visit to the blue hills of Milton.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a month later, and winter had begun,
when Westover and Margaret&mdash;just entering
the house&mdash;went to the clock and set it going.
She said something&mdash;no matter what. He
said nothing, but gathering her head to his
breast, he caressed her. Words seemed superfluous.
</p>

A strong and impressive story&mdash;one of the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
